Yes, I'm 16 for those who could tell I was young. I was in the very early stages of opioid addiction. Someone called me a garbage can and I think that perfectly sums it up. Some of you probably saw my, what I like to call when the drug demon comes out, posts. I had questions about heroin and such, of course, clear-headed it's not something I want to try. 

Anyways, about last night. It was late and I could tell my urges were getting worse and worse so I hit a meeting. I spoke to where I was and I was worried I was going to relapse and that I was not doing great. I got a list of numbers and went home. When I got home I was deep into my drug mind. I figured out that there is a guy who lives less than a minute walking distance away from me and is selling Vicodin(my poison) at 5 a pop. Of course, I hear this and immediately start to sell my shit. I had started to go outside to sell an Xbox controller when I got caught by my mom. She didn't know what I was doing but I ended up not being able to sell it. Which I believe is a small miracle. Otherwise, I would have been high that night.

I finally ended up stop ignoring my sponsor and I gave him a call. He was very supportive and I told him what had happened. I told him even from those little interactions with my mom and being secretive and reverting back to addict behavior I didn't want to live like that again. 

I realize I have to do something different in my life. I have to change my mindset. I must set myself up for success otherwise I will end up a true heroin addict or dead from the pills in a month or two. I know that because that's how I am and I can't ever stop. I know the nights are when it gets difficult and I have this toxic obsession with getting high that completely consumes me. I need to workout or plan my evenings so I don't have time to think about drugs, when I'm busy I can be clean.  


Thank you for reading. Additionally, I have a website that discloses addicts' stories and helps carry the message to the addict who still suffers. I know I don't have long clean but it's been helping me stay clean. Any support would be awesome! If you want to add your story j hmu.

I was addicted to opiates (oxys) for almost 15 years and got up to 1700 mgs 70 perc 30s a day towards the end for 3 consistent years. It was just an absolute nightmare waking up having to snort 10 pills just to get out of bed then 3 hours later another 10 and so on. I truly wanted to die I had no more euphoria at all from these pills. 

I was up two years ago standing outside and said to the universe I need help now or I am going to die please show me something. I called a methadone clinic they wouldn‚Äôt accept me unless I weaned down to about 600 mgs which was impossible to do. I really felt hopeless at that point. The next night my audio engineer sent a post about ibogaine from a Podcast and I was shocked. No way there is something out there that can take away the physical and mental withdrawal in such short time and bring my mind back to a pre addictive state. So I started to call treatment centers I had just enough money to go to one and I would be broke but I didn't care. Most places I called were either sketchy or would tell me to send the money upfront. As an addict when you are seeking help it can be a very scary process. I ended up going to a place and taking the risk luckily it was safe and I got treatment.

Now I will say even though the place saved my life I didn't like the owner and besides the treatment didn't offer much assistance on aftercare. It still was the best decision I made because it broke the addiction and I had very minimal withdrawal if any at all. So basically i took 3 flood doses over 14 days and the first one wow I got up 4 hours after the treatment and I said to myself there is no way I am not sick and have not taken any pills in 24 hours!!!! The next few days I just felt very tired and wanted to rest they give you gabapentin to help sleep and vitamins in an IV to replenish your system. On the 4th day I took another full treatment and this was the one. I had this very warm feeling all over my body of love from the universe and I could vividly see my life and what was holding me back from staying sober all the way down to my childhood. I was sober for 3 years through AA and the twelve steps it was like writing a fourth step in 4 hours it was just so humbling and enlightening.

Now people out there who say you go through 0 Withdrawals in my experience it wasn't true you have beaten your body up for years so there is no slap on the wrist. If I were to say out of 100 percent I felt 75 percent after that second treatment physically but the difference between this ibogaine and anything else I could have done was that my mind was clear, awake, and not depressed no PAWS. So I had the mental and spiritual strength to say holy shit I can really do this I cant believe it. 

A few days later I got my final treatment and that is the one that took care of the lingering 25% stuff physically I had going on. Now what I mean physically is it was not anything unbearable. I basically just was a little sweaty not cold sweats and hot flashes. I just felt my body cleaning itself in a good way. My mind was seriously so clear and lazar focused. The only physical symptoms I had the whole time was I had trouble sleeping because my mind was so awake from the ibogaine and I was just tired Physically for a few weeks. Every-time they gave me a treatment though I would feel great physically. 

Now if you are trying to just go take ibogaine and think its a cure you need to think different. You need to understand it gives you a window of opportunity to not feel like shit and focus on long term recovery without having to wait months for mental and physical symptoms to go away. If you use ibogaine as a detox tool and set up aftercare which the place I am in touch with now that I went back for a tune up does your chances of full recovery will be very high.

Anyways I don't want to make this to long just remember I was on 1700 Milagrams Of OXY a day that is the worst of the worst pill habit you can have and I truly just want to help people and not have them feel they are going to mexico and are going to get robbed or ripped off be very careful before you chose which center. 

If anyone has any questions please pm me I will be more than happy to help and guide you in the right direction. You deserve a better life we all do we never wanted to become this way and just know as bad as it feels now you are exactly were you are supposed to be and one day you will know why you went through everything you went through.

I‚Äôm addicted coke and weed. I can‚Äôt deny it. I‚Äôm at rock bottom too and am in financial ruins. I tried an outpatient addictions program and just kept using the whole time. It wasn‚Äôt enough.

What I‚Äôve recently come to terms with is the fact I need rehab. Like inpatient rehab complete with an initial period of detox. At this point in my addiction to coke, I‚Äôm using to avoid the withdrawal as much as I am chasing a high. 

The withdrawal period terrifies me. I anticipate experiencing extreme emotional dysregulation, depression, anxiety, and possibly suicidal ideation. I need to do this in a medically supervised environment. 

I‚Äôve just written a lengthy and completely honest email to my parents that I will send in the next coming days. In it, I lay everything out on the table and ask for their financial support in the rehab bill as it will be at a private facility. 

I‚Äôm terrified to quit using coke and to take at least a long T Break. Entering rehab is beyond scary. But I just can‚Äôt keep using the way I am. It‚Äôs ruined my life and it happened so so quickly. I didn‚Äôt have a problem until I started using coke during this depressing pandemic as a way to cope with my loneliness.

I had horrible withdraws from cold sweats to not eating to night mares every night so bad I was terrified to even go to sleep. Well after that 2 weeks I broke down and smoked a blunt.

\-some redditor‚Äôs friend

I‚Äôm pretty crazy. I mean I know that's not a great way to say I have a whole host of mental problems, but it‚Äôs the way I‚Äôm feeling when I see peoples reactions to my behaviour. Some four years ago I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety. ‚ÄúOk, that doesn‚Äôt sound too bad, a mild case then.‚Äù I thought, completely unable to connect that to my experience. Only later on I realized it‚Äôs not the lack of seriousness hiding behind the condition's name, but that of narrowing its occurrence qualifiers. Because my anxiety shoots at will. I mean there are some recurring themes, events involving other people, being judged, broadly speaking, rejected,  but pretty much anything can trigger it. The impending doom vibe of 2020, was just fucking peachy for me. 

I‚Äôm 34 now, and for almost all of my life I didn‚Äôt even know I was afraid. ‚ÄúNow that sounds like you‚Äôre just ‚Ä¶‚Äù I‚Äôll stop you right there, ok? Because, you see, that‚Äôs where it connects to another issue that's making my life miserable. Difficult, strong emotions, are lava. And I will do the most bizarre thighs to avoid them. All of my coping mechanisms are ways to escape. I'm a trash junkie, more on that later. I don‚Äôt need food or sleep when playing an exciting game or binging a tv show or a yt channel. I fall into delusional thinking, and outright fantasy lands, on a dime. Everyone I ever knew I pushed away preemptively. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the depression, the hideous face of which is in my rear mirror at all times. Yeah, I‚Äôm so happy and proud, I made a thing today with an old power cord.

I stated my age just there, to say something of my dedication to escape. I‚Äôve been so consistent with it, I never recognized my pursuers. Well, not until a while after that diagnosis at least. I always called it stress or tension if I had to call it anything. Never stopped to look behind, always running, late I started looking for appropriate medical assistance. Wanna know a fun thing? Relationships with professionals also make me want to get out. And so none lasted long enough to actually help me much. But at least I learned enough bits and pieces to be able to write something hopefully consistent and true about it all at this moment.

I called myself trash junkie earlier because it never really mattered what psychoactive substance I used, as long as it made me feel good and calm. There was alcohol, as all of my teen peers drank. There was mj cause it was fun to laugh, eat and forget. But codeine stuck the longest because it was easy. Any pharmacy, no prescription, cheap, no interactions with anybody, but at the counter for 20 seconds. And then bliss for a while. It‚Äôs very weak compared to other opiates, but required so little of me, It was enough combined with computer addiction to keep me in stasis for about ten fucking years. Until it wasn‚Äôt. Over the years, very slowly accumulated knowledge of myself and the reality of my life pushed me more and more to wanting to break this spell, to escape, lul.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2019. A medium length period of stable sobriety, and some of the more honest introspections I ever experienced, resulted in a new pursuit to address another problem I had, ‚Äúdifficulties with thinking‚Äù, yych. The attention deficit part of the condition explained perfectly for me at the time why there‚Äôs two conflicting sets of memories I have about myself. One of a ridiculous idiot, and another of a moderately intelligent person. There are some specific conditions, which if met make it a lot easier for a sufferer to focus and maintain a consistent train of thought. There were complications however, ADHD is treated with stimulants, and I had immense difficulty not to abuse the medication. As with benzos for anxiety.  Eventually I relapsed with codeine, and upon revealing that to my doctor, the treatment seized. It lasted enough though to launch me into a few weeks of demented narciccism. Always had some tendencies, mostly tempered with depression and no self esteem at all. But once in a while it turns to 11, and well, it‚Äôs not a pretty sight to see. I have profound regrets.

Oh, right, the title. Well, I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs the worst thing anymore, but it sounded comforting, mabie because it placed the blame solely on other people. Some understanding would be nice tho. Right now I think the worst is that all of those problems are a perpetual self sustaining feedback loop of doom and despair. Not only trouble in itself but also a way to make getting out more difficult. I couldn‚Äôt ask for help if my life depended on it, heh. Don‚Äôt really have anybody to ask anymore anyway. Ok, I‚Äôm done lamenting my situation. It‚Äôs 8 day without codeine this time. I‚Äôm at a crossroads, and I have no idea what will happen.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7316139}"

While the word mantra originated as a Hindu ‚Äúsacred utterance,‚Äù people use mantras every day to guide their efforts at home, at work, and at school. The popular culture definition of mantra has evolved to mean repetitive slogan, personal truth, or structured thought. Adopting one or more mantras as part of your addiction recovery experience is a focused way to achieve your objectives and remain motivated. Words have a powerful way of changing behaviors, thought patterns, and emotions over time. Consider mantras a tool in your toolbox: useful for chanting when you are tempted to use or for achieving focused calm during meditation.

**Mantras for Drug & Alcohol Treatment**

I am a worthwhile, deserving person. By undervaluing themselves, addicts spiral into a dangerous pattern of self-deprecation and low self-esteem. Use this mantra as a reminder that you are lovable, valuable, and deserving of wellness and joy.

I am in control of my life. At first, these words may seem hollow. After all, most addicts feel as if their lives are spinning out of control with drugs and alcohol in the driver‚Äôs seat. Use this mantra to take a stand. Addiction does not control you; you are in control of your destiny and you have a supportive rehabilitation team ready to help.

I am not alone. Feelings of isolation can quickly give way to destructive behaviors. When you are in the grip of loneliness, remind yourself of this truth and call on your community of family, friends, and counselors to help you avoid making a negative choice.

I am making progress. While your steps may seem small, you are moving in the right direction when you seek addiction treatment. Live in the moment, celebrating small triumphs and reminding yourself that each forward step takes you further from the bondage of addiction and toward the freedom of sobriety.

I will not give in to my drug or alcohol craving today. While it is important to acknowledge that sobriety is a lifelong effort, getting through today is the most important thing on your agenda. Chant this mantra when you are feeling tempted to drink or use drugs. Meditate on it when you are in the middle of a stressful situation. Resisting substance use today fuels you to take another stand tomorrow.

Please help!,"TLDR: Its my first week of withdrawal. Im so anxious, paranoid, depressed and having hot/cold waves. I think im losing my mind. I need some advice, any help is appreciated.

Hi. So, I've been using buprenorphine, benzodiazepines and weed 5 years on daily basis. I've been 1 week in rehab at the moment. 
Im feeling so sick, i think im losing my mind.. Its so hard to even focus and write this post. It feels like im going to die. My heart is pounding, im sweating, feeling cold, anxious, depressed having thoughts everyone tries to hurt or kill me. 
I'm currently on diazepam medication, doctor gives me only 5mg of diazepam 4 times a day. It won't help at all, only helps me to not have seizures. I can take olanzapine, clonidine, melatonin, hydroxyzine and propanonol if necessary. But those won't do anything else, than put me to zombiemode and still having these feelings. It's hard to sleep even with all these meds together. 
My friend brought me 2mg buprenorphine, because i had suicidal thoughts and almost tried to kill my self with these meds. I feel so desperate. Now my feeling is somehow better, obviously because of bupe. So i use this advantage to write this post and asking help/advice. How the **** can I cope with these feelings... I know i will eventually get better but thinking that won't help. 
This rehab feels like torturing. Now it's been only 1 week and my doctor reduced my 5mg x 4mg diazepam meds to 5mg x 3mg. Im supposed to be here 2 week in total and these medication reductions are brutal. Everyday she (doctor) takes 5mg off, and I have to be last 2 days WITHOUT ANY BENZODIAZEPINES. And after 2 weeks have passed, they move me to rehab where medications aren't allowed. I know already i will have horrible withdrawals when im without meds, because im already feeling too bad. Im hopeless, i cant even exercise here, because this COVID-19 situation. I find exercising even somehow helpful. We can go for a walk 30 minutes/day. I can leave from here whenever i want, but i know that only leads to me start using drugs again.. What can i do? üò≠

Some background information here;
I have had terrible childhood. I were in children care institution (or what is it called idk, im from Finland, so my english isn't perfect). 
My mom was depressed because my dad left us when i was only 2 years old. And I have ADHD, so she couldn't do anything else but send me there when i were 10yrs old. In the children care place the people who worked there beated us, insulted us and were very harsh and mean to us. And one 12yrs old girl got raped by one of the workers. It was sick place and affected everyone mentally. I started using weed, alcohol and benzos in age of 13 because of these horrible things they did to us. We told social workers and cops about these things and the workers said we are being delusional and wanted to ruin their reputation. 
I got PTSD, General Anxiety Disorder, Chronic depression and terrible childhood thanks to them. That lead me to use drugs. I tried to kill myself several times but i couldn't because it is hard to do. Im glad i didn't end up killing myself tho.. 

I got released from that shitty place when i was 18. I had wonderful time, I fell in love and got my past love of my life pregnant. And now i have reason to live. A wonderful son. We were 4 years together and broke. After that i fell into a rabbithole. My dreams crushed and I started to do what was familiar to me. Stifle my feelings with drugs. So here i am. I need to stop using drugs because of my 5yrs old son. He is my everything and reason to live.

Hope that's okay.

Anyway, I (22 f) have been smoking for 8 years, since I was 14. I've always liked cigarettes, so that's why I smoke them. But I have never felt addicted, I've never experienced withdrawals, etc. When I'm too broke, I don't buy them and I have no problem going without. It's rare that I do go without them, but when I have to, it's not a big deal. Sometimes I go without smoking just cause I don't feel like smoking. Usually cigarettes smell and taste great to me, but there are moments when I think they smell and taste awful. Sometimes for many days at a time, but never more than a week or so. 

From a chemical/psychological/medical standpoint, is it possible for me to not be addicted? I wasn't a \*big\* smoker when I was a young teen because they were hard to get my hands on, but ever since I was about 17 I've been smoking at least a few packs a week, sometimes a pack a day (except when I've been too broke, or when I just didn't feel like smoking for a while). I have no intention or desire to quit but that's only because I like to smoke. Am I lying to myself? I literally don't know what withdrawals feel like, but I don't understand how that is possible. 

My mom (50 f) has told me that she smoked for a couple of years in her youth but easily quit cold turkey when she found out she was pregnant. The same thing happened with my sister (29 f) who smoked from 22-27 years old. But our other sister (31 f) is very much addicted to cigarettes since she was 18, and has been trying to quit for years with only short periods of success. 

I just have a hard time believing it's possible for me not to be addicted, even though I also know that I'm not, and I believe my mom & sister never were either. 

I did some googling but couldn't really find anything conclusive. I understand that you all may have some knowledge about addiction here, so any of your insight would be really valuable and appreciated.

2021-01-28 20:55:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l7fuqh/sober_living_homes/,Sober Living Homes,"Sober living is an incredibly valuable tool for recovery, as it allows recent inpatient clients (and some intensive outpatient clients) to live in a drug- and alcohol-free home with other individuals who are focused on recovery. Sober living is especially helpful for those transitioning out of rehab centers who would prefer to start out in a safe, temptation-free environment.

For most clients, sober living at [Oak Forest Recovery](https://oakforestrecovery.com/) becomes an option after the initial residential treatment portion of the program is successfully completed. Within the structure of sober living, each client is equipped to effectively integrate their sober foundation with real-life fundamentals. Each Men & Women‚Äôs house is managed by a full-time house manager, and the purpose of each house is to offer clients the practical support of living sober on their own.

The life of recovery is one that is built over time, and we believe in a commitment to daily, healthy habits that are established with repetition and discipline. Within the family environment, clients find that returning to work, school, and daily life is more easily accomplished in the presence of like-minded people.

**What are Sober Living Homes?**

A sober living home is a specialized residence designed to provide a safe, substance-free environment for those recovering from drug or alcohol addiction. Residents cook, clean, manage finances, and take care of other everyday responsibilities independently, just as they would in any other home. Residents live, eat, socialize, and attend 12-step meetings together as roommates, supporting one another through the challenges of maintaining their newfound sobriety.

At **Oak Forest Recovery** , we recognize that not all clients will be ready to return to ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù right away. We also recognize that the journey of recovery for each client has its own unique pace. Once a client is accepted to a sober living house, he or she is welcome to stay for as long as needed, even if it takes years.

If you need transitional living space after an inpatient rehab program, you may be struggling to decide between living with loved ones or applying for a place in a sober living facility. To determine whether sober living is a good fit for you",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.61344075}"

    This is probably my third post ever to Reddit, so forgive me if I broke some posting rules and my formatting is garbage. I‚Äôm 27 years old and have always been very curious about altered states of consciousness, particularly psychedelics. 

    When I moved back to my home town from college, I met some guys from my public school days and started regularly drinking and smoking weed with them. I was 19 at the time. From then to now, I experimented fairly regularly with a variety of substances, having quit them all or as is the case with psychedelics, using extremely infrequently. 

   Now, getting more to the point, I just smoke weed and drink. Every day. And I don‚Äôt want to, at least, not in some knee-jerk compulsive fashion where it‚Äôs hard to control consumption. For the last 4 years, every new year I‚Äôve challenged myself to quit for 3 months. And I fail every time. I‚Äôve drank more days this January than I haven‚Äôt and it drives me crazy. 

    And it feels like I don‚Äôt have any support in my waking life (of course there‚Äôs my family but I‚Äôm too proud to tell them I‚Äôve failed yet again). It feels like despite my eagerness to help and support those around me, the majority aren‚Äôt too eager to return the favour, and I often feel embarrassed or worse off for it. So I stopped looking for support, and have been having this ‚Äúsilent‚Äù internal battle for years now. 

    Things were starting to look up after I got out of an extremely unhealthy relationship, but then the lockdowns and restrictions came and now it‚Äôs next to impossible to meet and genuinely connect with others and keep my mind away from substance abuse. I ‚Äúknow‚Äù the textbook solutions to my problems, but I‚Äôm lacking the necessary faith and drive to put in the work for those solutions. I mean, it‚Äôs been at least 4 years of trying and failing. 

    I have a great family, a couple good friends, a nice apartment, a secure job, lots of hobbies, my health, lots of stuff going for me. But I can‚Äôt shake the loneliness, the feeling that while they may occasionally lend an ear, those around me don‚Äôt actually give a damn about my problems, the feeling I‚Äôm on a different wavelength than those around me, and the inevitable boredom that comes with a lack of genuine connection and socialization. 

    And this is what makes it so hard for me to sober up. At least time flies and my hobbies have renewed interest when I‚Äôm drinking and/or smoking. And hey no one wants to spend time together these days so why be sober? I also think I‚Äôve spent so much time on substances that I‚Äôve started to lose sight of who I am and that‚Äôs terrifying, which is the main reason for wanting to stop and my inability to stop. 

    I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs a bit of a rant. I guess what I mean to ask is, do you guys have any advice for a guy in my situation that is atypical from the traditional advice given? I really appreciate it, I‚Äôm not one to open up like this, this took forever to write out. Thanks for reading.",4,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.692664}"

My mother was recently hospitalized and we are all so confused as to what happened. I would love to hear your thoughts considering many of you have a special understanding of addiction.

The details are a little muddy as I received all this information second- or third-hand so I appreciate your patience.

My mother began acting more incoherent than usual a couple nights ago, so the man she is staying with got worried and took her to the hospital. Unfortunately because of COVID the ER was pretty overrun and it took them nearly 11 hours to see her. Once they did, they were worried she had a stroke so they did an MRI which came back inconclusive.

Because her veins are shot from years of drug abuse, they put in a midline and admitted her and ran dozens of tests‚Äî CT scan, EKG, chest X-ray, brain waves, etc. Everything came back inconclusive.

Once she finally did wake up, she was completely incoherent, talking nonsense. Finally she woke up enough to be agitated and started yelling at the nurses that they can‚Äôt keep her here. They sedated her temporarily and then once she woke back up they released her since she didn‚Äôt want to stay.

On the way home, she passed out once again, woke up, was speaking nonsense again, but convinced the man she stays with to not take her back to the hospital.

Was this just a really bad binge, or maybe a bad batch of drugs? I‚Äôve never seen her this bad off for such a length of time. As far as what she‚Äôs on, she has been dependent on pills for years and has been on and off heroine. She also drinks heavily.

i won't get into too much detail about my past because i'm trying to focus on the present, but i feel it's important to preface this with a little bit of it so you can understand me. i'm about to turn 30. i started using heroin when i was 16 and a year and a half ago, after putting myself and my loved ones through absolute hell, i finally quit.

my hand was kind of forced, really. i was in a relationship with a girl who, at the time, was in rehab. i was using heavily, trying to find a way to quit by the time she got out but, halfway through her rehab stint, i developed endocarditis from a dirty shot. if you don't know already, endocarditis is a potentially life-threatening infection of a heart valve. what happens is that the bacteria (or fungi, but bacteria in my case) in your shot settles on whatever valve it finds hospitable, and begins to colonize. your heart then pumps this bacteria out to your entire body.

i was very sick, and hospitalized for two months. my girlfriend and i remained open and honest through this time, and i decided enough was enough, i was going to get clean. i got on subs in the hospital and went to live with a friend. my girl finished rehab, we got a place, and all was well for a while...

shit, i said i wasn't going to drag out my past and here i am balls deep in it. it's not what's important, so i'm going to wrap it real quick: eventually she relapsed, i found out that the infection had damaged a valve and i would need surgery, and we wasted 6 months of each others lives while i tried to fix her (i did relapse once during this time but got back on track within two days and havent' looked back). i finally put an end to it and moved to my uncle's while i waited to have surgery, with plans of recovering there and moving on with my life. (surgery was scheduled for october 5th).

now fast forward to the present. my surgery has been put off more than once at this point, and i am still waiting. the ball is rolling again, but it's still slow going. i'm still staying with my uncle, (who's awesome btw) and his girlfriend. it's not the greatest out here, but it's not awful by any means.

still, i'm fucking miserable. i mean, crippling, debilitating depression. it's been a long time since i've been this low, and i'm not sure what to do. i'm fucking lost.

i saw the cardiologist today. he had heard i relapsed and stressed to me that if we go ahead with this surgery, putting a needle in my arm afterwords would be a death wish. the new valve will be extremely susceptible to infection, and i likely wouldn't bounce back from it were it to happen. i told him i knew, that i was in a really bad place when i relapsed, it's been 9 months, etc. he said alright, and now i'm scheduled for pre-op stuff.

but, on the ride home, i started thinking. really thinking. i'm so fucking miserable right now. i mean, scaring people miserable at times. i've been saying from the jump i don't know how long i'll end up being sober and, while it doesn't seem likely in the immediate future (for a few different reasons), i don't know if i should even have the surgery anymore. i feel like my sobriety is becoming less and less worth it by the minute. the reasons i have left to stay clean at this point are other people, namely my grandparents, and parole. well, i'm not sure how long my grandparents have left and i'll be off parole by the end of the year. 

fuck, i had pictured this turning into a well thought-out post, but it isn't, nor will it become one. i don't even have a point. i just hate life, i hate myself, i hate being sober, and i want to fucking crawl in a hole and die at the thought of not even having the option to shoot up again without risking my life immediately. there aren't words for this, not good ones. i would kill just to be held by another person right now. and now i'm crying. and i didn't even really say anything. guess i'll wrap this. if you made it to the end, you're a saint.

Here are a couple of my favorites that helped me in my early recovery. Hopefully they can bring you some peace and perhaps give you some hope if you are new to sobriety (been there)or struggling with time in sobriety (been there too :)

A. Get comfortable being uncomfortable. 

That was the best advice I received in early sobriety. When I first got sober, my brain was not 100% right and I had to let time elapse for the elasticity of the brain to heal itself. Depression, anxiety, emotional fluctuations, etc. these are all NORMAL. The secret is to not give up and know that as time goes on, it gets BETTER. What you are experiencing in this moment will not last forever, even if you think you are somehow special or different. People used to tell me it would get better and I didn‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs true AS LONG AS YOU STAY SOBER. Your brain will heal but it takes a little bit of time. It‚Äôs TOTALLY WORTH IT!

B. This too shall pass.

The bad times will pass. The good times will pass. Knowing that the good times will pass allows me to appreciate it more. The bad times don‚Äôt last forever and usually at the end, I come out wiser and more spiritual. I need the bad times to truly appreciate the good. Both are part of life for ALL people not just SOBER people. Overall, regardless of good or bad, I feel DAILY CONTENTMENT and I‚Äôm grateful to be sober.

C. It works if you work it

Regardless of how you get sober (AA, church, etc), you get out of your recovery what you put in. Prayer, meditation, healthy eating, getting enough sleep, exercise, doing hobbies I love, spending time with those I care about. The more I feed the solution, the happier I am as a person. If you put positive action into your life, you will reap the rewards. I cannot think my way into new thinking BUT I can act my way into new thinking. Even just cleaning my house, making the bed, calling my sponsor/mom/friend, these are small actions that can dramatically alter the course of my day. If I am feeling negative, 1) recognizing that I am experiencing this negative emotion 2) accepting that it is part of how I am expediting the world at this time 3) commit a positive action - these 3 usually get me out of my head and into a more accepting/peaceful place. Sometimes they don‚Äôt work and the best thing for me to do is just make it through the day and hit my head on the pillow sober. Tomorrow‚Äôs a new day and it will get better!

I hope this helped someone and shoot me a DM if you need someone for support.

My mom has been an alcoholic since I was at least 15. I'm 32. She had a seizure two years ago which prompted my family and her friends to have an intervention. She left rehab early and it's been a rocky recovery over the past 2 hears, which is expected.  She is sober for a few weeks at a time, but definitely not longer than that. 

I want to support but I don't want to enable her. The last few times we have spoken it's been ""I love you. I support you getting sober, but I can't have you in my life when you're still drinking. Please get help."" She is in several online recovery groups, but is still drinking. She hides tiny booze bottles all over her house and accidentally left empties in a Christmas package she mailed to me. I am proud of her for being in the support groups and can't even begin to imagine how hard this battle is. 

I believe she has a long way to go before I let her back into my life. I don't want to let her back in too early and enable her drinking. I am concerned I am a trigger for her drinking too. At the same time, I want to support her. My dad makes me feel like I have abandoned her, but I see it as tough love.

I was addicted to opiates (oxys) for almost 15 years and got up to 1700 mgs 70 perc 30s a day towards the end for 3 consistent years. It was just an absolute nightmare waking up having to snort 10 pills just to get out of bed then 3 hours later another 10 and so on. I truly wanted to die I had no more euphoria at all from these pills.

I was up two years ago standing outside and said to the universe I need help now or I am going to die please show me something. I called a methadone clinic they wouldn‚Äôt accept me unless I weaned down to about 600 mgs which was impossible to do. I really felt hopeless at that point. The next night my audio engineer sent a post about ibogaine from a Joe Rogan Podcast and I was shocked. No way there is something out there that can take away the physical and mental withdrawal in such short time and bring my mind back to a pre addictive state. So I started to call treatment centers I had just enough money to go to one and I would be broke but I didn't care. Most places I called were either sketchy or would tell me to send the money upfront. As an addict when you are seeking help in another country it can be a very scary process. I ended up going to a place and taking the risk luckily it was safe and I got treatment.

Now I will say even though the place saved my life I didn't like the owner and besides the treatment didn't offer much assistance on aftercare. It still was the best decision I made because it broke the addiction and I had very minimal withdrawal if any at all. So basically i took 3 flood doses over 14 days and the first one wow I got up 4 hours after the treatment and I said to myself there is no way I am not sick and have not taken any pills in 24 hours!!!! The next few days I just felt very tired and wanted to rest they give you gabapentin to help sleep and vitamins in an IV to replenish your system. On the 4th day I took another full treatment and this was the one. I had this very warm feeling all over my body of love from the universe and I could vividly see my life and what was holding me back from staying sober all the way down to my childhood. I was sober for 3 years through AA and the twelve steps it was like writing a fourth step in 4 hours it was just so humbling and enlightening.

Now people out there who say you go through 0 Withdrawals in my experience it wasn't true you have beaten your body up for years so there is no slap on the wrist. If I were to say out of 100 percent I felt 75 percent after that second treatment physically but the difference between this ibogaine and anything else I could have done was that my mind was clear, awake, and not depressed no PAWS. So I had the mental and spiritual strength to say holy shit I can really do this I cant believe it.

A few days later I got my final treatment and that is the one that took care of the lingering 25% stuff physically I had going on. Now what I mean physically was not anything unbearable remember its mexico so you will be hot anyways. I basically just was a little sweaty not cold sweats and hot flashes. I just felt my body cleaning itself in a good way. My mind was seriously so clear and lazar focused. The only physical symptoms I had the whole time was I had trouble sleeping because my mind was so awake from the ibogaine and I was just tired Physically for a few weeks. Every-time they gave me a treatment though I would feel great physically.

Now if you are trying to just go take ibogaine and think its a cure you need to think different. You need to understand it gives you a window of opportunity to not feel like shit and focus on long term recovery without having to wait months for mental and physical symptoms to go away. If you use ibogaine as a detox tool and set up aftercare which the place I am in touch with now that I went back for a tune up does your chances of full recovery will be very high.

Anyways I don't want to make this to long just remember I was on 1700 Milagrams Of OXY a day that is the worst of the worst pill habit you can have and I truly just want to help people and not have them feel they are going to mexico and are going to get robbed or ripped off be very careful before you chose which center.

If anyone has any questions please pm me I will be more than happy to help and guide you in the right direction. You deserve a better life we all do we never wanted to become this way and just know as bad as it feels now you are exactly were you are supposed to be and one day you will know why you went through everything you went through.

2021-01-27 13:42:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l6bgyy/the_weed_these_days_is_basically_crack/,The weed these days is basically crack,"I've been smoking pot for like 15 years and the weed they have these days isn't even real fucking weed anymore. This shit is ridiculous. 33% THC. 35% THC. Holy fuck where do they even fit the plant matter? They're just gonna sell you THC crystals to smoke soon enough. Meanwhile, 0% CBD (the main mind-soothing, antipsychotic, nonpsychoactive canabinoid as far as we know)¬†on most of it. This weed and the weed they had 30 or even 10 years ago are not the same thing at all. The weed I grew up smoking had probably 15% THC tops and it probably had at least some CBD and who knows what other canabinoids. The weed they got today is basically just fiber and THC. It's not a whole lot different than processing cocoa leaves to make blow or opium poppys to make heroin.¬†At this point, the whole 'I'm just smoking a plant like gaya mother earth whatthefuckever intended' no longer stands. Not like it was any good to begin with.

Everyone's running around anxious and neurotic getting medical cards to self-sooth because society forgot how to develop coping mechanisms not seeing any connection between how they're feeling and their bombarding of their organism with molecules that, yes, it does have receptors for all over. That's exactly why it's a problem. This stuff is one of the only fat-soluble drugs we take. It can linger for months attached to receptors in your brain, CNS, GI tract, lungs, liver, everything. Do you know the impact it has everywhere. No. Nobody does.

It will definitely not kill you. I have tried. It will not. I've been smoking about a quarter pound a month of the strongest weed I can find in Chicago for like 8 months and I'm fine. Definitely not optimal or anywhere close. But my family is fed, my bills are paid, and the deadlifts are being deadlifted. It's a very mopey existence though. I only came to terms with this and decided I'm quitting like a month ago. I just got off a 3-week sobriety stretch. I lift and sauna almost daily, eat clean, walk, all that shit. I was still pissing dirty and heavily so. And every time I burn fat for fuel, which is every fucking day, some of that THC gets metabolized and dispersed throughout me.

Fucking Tommy Chong and Snoop Dogg glorifying weed and being high all day. Yeah maybe it works out if you're a low-T 65-year-old millionaire.¬†Bunch of dumb kids running around with their 420 yoloblazeit shit. I bet you not one of those motherfuckers actually smokes all day. I actually smoke all day. I can afford to and they can't because they're 16 and I'm not and the internet is run by children. I smoke 1-2 bong bowls immediately upon waking up - before drinking water even. Because I'm mildly nauseous any time I'm sober and that goes for water too. I smoke joints while I drive. I have to be high to sleep. I have to be high to eat. I have zero appetite¬†even high though. I'm probably only downing like 1500 calories of actual food right now. If it weren't for this Fairlife whole milk, I'd be a skinny bitch like every other permastoner by now. I cough up shit that looks like black/green mold constantly. I know they say you can't get cancer smoking weed, but I don't wanna be the first guy. My mood is fucking garbage if I'm not at least mildly high. I can't handle normal day-to-day stresses sober - even minor ones. I'm addicted as fuck to pot. And I'm addicted as fuck to caffeine too because you have to be if you're gonna be high all day and still be productive. So I need to quit both those things.

'Oh, JortsShorts is probably just a bitchass. You can't get addicted to pot. My buddy Brad who has a lot of experience with addiction told me.' Well Brad is wrong. I've been in the addiction game since a young age. I've been addicted to and successfully quit alcohol, benzos, cigarettes, and heroin. And video games as a kid if you wanna count that. But I can not shake pot. It is so insidious. I can get it delivered to my mailbox. And I can realistically keep living like this for years and years and nothing acutely bad will happen. I'll just be duller, dumber, less knowledgeable, less creative, less passionate, a worse dad, a worse husband, a worse athlete, a worse businessman - but still good enough to get by. I'm not comfortable just getting by though.

Should have just listened in DARE class way back when!

Oh - and the cherry on top? I don't even fucking get high really. I haven't been high high in foreeverrrrr. I blended an ounce of 33% THC weed with 3 grams of the strongest wax I could find. Like in a blender. This isn't even a thing people do. It's not even a concept because it's so wasteful. I didn't care. I smoke that and I still can not catch a proper high.",92,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8360881}"

In Mexico he bought some anxiety medication and I noticed over the last three weeks he's developed a problem. I genuinely don't think he had a problem before this but I don't know. Were both bipolar and I know we're predisposed to substance abuse but I just didn't know it'd be like this. I've started feeling like he feels like he can't be himself around me without taking something or drinking wine.

On Friday, we were making dinner then suddenly he started slurring and saying how much he loves me, sees us getting married, etc. but it didn't match with the one glass of wine he had so I knew he had taken something and asked him. He denied it at first then came clean he did. I ended up babysitting him the whole night and told him I don't enjoy him when he's like that. Then he met my mom for the first time on Saturday night for dinner and everything was great! Then on the way home he said he felt my mother didn't like him so we got into a little argument but made up and he said he was trying to fix his mood. An hour before bed I started noticing the slurring again only this time it was way worse. He was dropping things, knocking things over, etc. He takes sleep medicine so I thought it was just that and (begrudgingly) helped into bed again.

Well, Sunday morning rolls around and I can barely wake him up. I get him in the shower but he falls out. I know now he's taken something the night before but I think he just needs to sleep it off so I put him back to bed and leave for a friends house. Well, when I didn't hear from him in another few hours I start to freak out and race back home and find him pretty much completely unresponsive and he soiled the bed. I naturally panic and call an ambulance where we manage to get out of him that he took anywhere from 3 muscle relaxers and 4 bars of xanax minimum!

He sobered up and was released from the hospital but the whole experience is completely traumatizing for me. I've been doing everything for him the last three days to make sure he's not alone, getting him into therapy, took him to a meeting tonight, etc. We dont live together but he went home to get clothes on Monday (ODed Sunday) and took a pill and tried to lie to me about it to my face when I asked him directly if he took anything when he got back because I could tell. He came clean and he was completely on board with getting help today and trying but I really needed him to be about me tonight.

We went to a meeting and I asked him if he had any thoughts about it and he said he prefers silence. So I told him I'm severely traumatized by him almost dying and I feel like he won't talk to me about it and his response was to pack his things and leave ""to give us time to think"" but he's not supposed to be alone because of his bipolar disorder and he needed support. I told him if he leaves it's the end of our relationship and he continued packing his stuff. I told him I've been supporting him for the last five days physically and emotionally and I just needed him to tell me things will be okay and he left anyway. 

I feel like letting him buy those pills was such a mistake but I didn't know and I can't wrap my head around the fact that I literally saved his life and he claims to love me and just walked out the door. I'm so confused right now.

**All of this changed so fast in the last 3 weeks. What can I do? Is the relationship even worth saving?**

I had a serious addiction to self pleasure and virtuality. i lived my whole life that way. raised and grew up forced to be religious since i was young. my dad was in the military and was forcing me to be religious and to learn only religion. or i was punished and slapped. i am telling you that to give you an idea about my childhood. my cousins often tells me that it was wrong that my parents treated us me and my brothers and sisters with who i have almost zero communication with. and that we missed alot of things in the past because of this. one of my sisters died of depression. and a nother one is sick with a blood sickness hiding her depression, she is 52 years old never talked to a guy never knew life. she has her own way to live only with religion that my parents tought us.and its very sad. i tried to help her but she told me one day to care about my own things and to not try to help her. anyways. back to me you have an idea about my family and me. my ex wife didnt know about my addiction and how blindly religious i was. i was selfish. and judging her if she wore clothes that shows her legs or stuff like that i was like my dad blind. we divorced after six years. she left me for a younger male that is from croatia and was normal. i was jealous because i never was able to be normal and i wont ever be probably. i moved to Austria to live with her when we got married. and was forced to leave and comeback to my parents house the only place that i had but before doing that i talked with my parents and told them that i do not want to hear one single word about religion or judging me. i will comeback to live in my room and thats it or else i will look for a place that i wont probably be able to afoard because i came back from austria with a few euros. it was hard for me to find any job other then construction worker or cleaning the streets because of my bad german. english and french wasnt taken in consideration in austria. so nowdays my life is very simple since my divorce in the end of 2017. i have a sleeping problem often i cant sleep at night so i sleep whenever im really tired in the day. i have no energy to look for a work here or the will to do that. i do not feel good coming back to my country. in Algeria the economy situation is really bad. the national currency lost all its value . 1 euro is 211 Algerian dinar. and Algeria import almost all the food that people consume through exporting Oil and gaz. most of that money goes for the people in the government. so i am living like that for years now i havent even went to do my divorce in my country. i divorced only in austria. and i am not willing to. i do not go outisde. i live in my room. i was sporty before and looking really good. after four years in bed. i cannot stand for a longer period of time, i feel pain in my back and legs. i lost alot of the muscle mass i had. i became more addicted to virtual sex. i consider myself as a looser. and i missed the perfect years of my life and the best opportunities that i had. i will be 32 years old soon. i have no vision for my future. so i am just living with my parents hiding in my room. not working. addicted. depressed. and i do not see anyway to change my situation now. i was playing in a game and one person told me that i should write in reddit to get some advice from people. the money i brought with me from Austria when i worked as a construction helper for a few months will come to an end soon. i know that im not able to work. i havent found any beermoney websites that works in my country. all of them are only for europe USA canada australia. not for the third word.

I have three addictions I have finally decided to face and stop. I'm going to tell a close friend of mine as well as my girlfriend for accountability reasons too to try and stay on track. 

First, is vaping. Picked it up a few years ago while in training for the military. I've been ashamed of it and I hide the habit from the ones I love but it's gotten bad to the point of ""taking bathroom breaks"" and ""inventorying"" so that I can sneak away to take a hit. I've hid it from my gf of 3 months too. 

Second, is biting my nails. This one goes deep, I'm most worried about kicking this one. I'll bite my nails and cuticles up so bad that I bleed and can't put pressure on my fingers. 

Last but not least, porn. In every recent relationship I've had (past 2 years), I've had issues getting it up and/or getting turned on enough to maintain an erection, most likely due to watching more and more porn and become desensitized. Sex became unspecial. It's gotten so bad that I've yanked one out in my car in a parking lot, or in the company bathroom. 

All I know is that I have to get better. When I got home from bootcamp was the healthiest I've been in probably a decade. Phones were gone for 4 months. No nicotine. No time or margin of error for me to bite my nails. I looked and felt amazing. 

I'm putting this out here as a personal accountability thing and also as a forum for any advice you all might have. Today I took the beginning steps. I threw my vape away, installed a porn blocker on my phone, and wore gloves the entire work day. I already feel antsy and irritated as shit. It's gonna be hard. Wish me luck boys. I gotta do it for my family, the girl I love, and for myself.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.59753484}"

My s/o just does not seem to understand me whatsoever. I remember when I first met her I was dumb and I offered to do some Ecstasy with her and I feel like she just looks at me different since then. She‚Äôll ask me to do drugs with her again after explaining what I go through and even telling her I want to try to be sober (I have for 2 months but she keeps tempting me). I don‚Äôt think it comes from a place of peer pressure its just immaturity and not bothering to put herself in my position. Its getting annoying to deal with. Recently she got pill earrings and I was taken back cause she know anything about drugs, only did it once with me. She told me she wanted me to wear them and I said no and asked her why she even bought them. She just said ‚ÄúI like the aesthetic of pills‚Äù and for some reason it made me so angry. Just yesterday there was a scene in a show where someone was injected with some sort of drug which she laughed about and said she wanted to do.. I just want to yell at her, tell her its fucked up because Im very understanding of her struggles and don‚Äôt act like this about them. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with these things without exploding on her bc I truly want to educate her. Does anyone have advice?",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8653857}"

Now that I've had some weed around for a week I'm ready to move on again. So I think about leaving work and I want to go get a vape pen with some nic salt in it. I want to buy a bottle to sip on. I want to re-up my stash of pot. 

But, every morning I feel slow and tired and crappy. I eat too much at night from the munchies or from being drunk and needing to eat something. I smoke nicotine too late before bed and I sleep terribly. Some of the worst sleep I've ever gotten is from nicotine vapes late at night. 

A voice in my mind has consistently whispered in my ear for many years, ""go completely clean."" But the thought of that seems impossible to pull off unless I was in a survival situation. Which still wouldn't matter. I'd still find some psychedelic mushrooms or find some tobacco plants or find a pot plant. 

You see, I can't help but get high on stuff. Never touched nor had anything remotely resembling a desire to touch heroine, coke, meth, pills, etc... Just weed, alcohol, and nicotine. Good ol American pass times.... I guess.

We‚Äôve known each other since middle school and he was my first boyfriend. (I was 12 he was 13) we broke up and he moved away but I always thought about him. My dad died of cancer when I was 15 and a few years later we reconnected and he told me his dad had cancer and I truly tried to be there in every way I could but I lived in ny and him in Florida. Anyway we kept in touch occasionally but he had gotten out of a long term relationship and was hurt. I just wanted to be theee for him. I realized I truly loved him because I didn‚Äôt exactly get jealous or mad when he would talk about her or wanting her back. I just wanted to be there and I wanted nothing more than to see him happy. I always thought he was my best friend. Even when I looked back on my life he was the first person I really just clicked with. We had the same sense of humor and could talk for hours... fast forward we went through a lot of times we didn‚Äôt talk or he would ghost me. But I always always reached out and ignored his fuck boy tendencies lol. But we finally got together in 2017.. we started hanging out and we were unsure about dating but we started sleeping together and hanging out and we decided to take the leap because of this random guy who was staying next door to him at the time, he was a old trucker dude but he told us that he only ever felt the same way about his wife and that she had died a few years ago with their daughter in a car crash and he literally cried to us and said we‚Äôd regret it if we let each other go. I‚Äôm a cancer he‚Äôs a Pisces and I honestly know in my heart we‚Äôre soul mates wait no scratch that. Twin flames. We‚Äôve been together almost 24/7 the last 4 years and we barely fight, we can go with or without sex for weeks and it dosent cause any resentment or whatever. We‚Äôre complete best friends . He dosent make me feel like I‚Äôm controlled or anything. We both are just completely comfortable together. It‚Äôs like my alone time is the same as us being together. Only thing we‚Äôve battled a bit of co dependency and we got into drugs together. I feel it‚Äôs different cuz we didn‚Äôt meet based on drugs. We met as young preteens and we don‚Äôt need drugs to communicate or be close with each other but we‚Äôve had a lot I mean ALOT OF haters saying 2 addicts can‚Äôt last etc. but we honestly have broken that stigma I think. I mean there‚Äôs some things that bother us or worry us but as of now we‚Äôre sober and doing methadone maintainence. Welll I‚Äôve had a IUD in for 8 years since my first daughter with another man. Well recently I went in for a bacterial infection and uti. Well my iud is the cause and there‚Äôs a bacteria in me that is caused by the iud and can cause problems... I‚Äôm going wedensday to get it taken out. I cannot be on any other form of birth control because I had blood clots with my first pregnancy and when I was 15 on YAZ.. we‚Äôve thought about having a baby , but we‚Äôre both on methadone (he‚Äôs on 80mg I‚Äôm on 50mg we both are going to start tapering) my concern is like idk if it‚Äôs smart. But I‚Äôm not really looking for any one here to say what we should or shouldn‚Äôt do but I‚Äôd love to hear your opinions/similar stories.. also I started this post to mention his family. His grandma is obsessed. I mean like he can do NO wrong and she sees me as the cause of his addiction which we both know we both are 50/50 responsible and it sucks because recently she was alone with him and mentioned a childhood friend of his(female) that they have known since they were little and his grandmother is close with... she said how she‚Äôs working 2 jobs and is successful and cares about him and misses him. This girl sends him messages every couple months saying I miss you and love you and blah I‚Äôll always be there and he never responds.. I told him hello she‚Äôs not just being a friend she obviously wants more from him. I might post pics of what she sent so you guys see. Also when I first met her she was renting an apartment out to him and his grandma and she didn‚Äôt like me from the beginning. (The girl not his grandma) his grandma used to love me when we first got together but ever since we came out we were addicts I know she just dosent want us together but she won‚Äôt come out and say it but she makes it obvious. She tries to be nice to me sometimes but it‚Äôs phony as shit. Come to find out his grandmother is friends with her on Facebook and comments every time she posts a picture calling her beautiful and says I love you gorgeous etc. and it fucking HURTS me so much. I know for a FACT she tells this girl that I‚Äôm bad for him, that he is stressed out and trying to do everything. When tbh I love him to death but I‚Äôm always the one who tells him to make doctor appointments or take care of himself. I‚Äôve given up a lot to be with him as he has me(I guess) I love him beyond normal ness and I get maybe to an unhealthy extent. But she cannot see him having flaws and it‚Äôs extremely unhealthy for him to be coddled. (His gram is 69 and he is 28, I‚Äôm 26 and this child girl friend of his is like 28 as well) his grandma has made excuses for his bad behavior since before we started dating . He got a dwi and she blamed everyone but him. He can do no wrong. I know that it‚Äôs good she loves him but she hasn‚Äôt ever accepted that some things he needs to be responsible for and even he sees how she is and has distanced himself because of this. But it‚Äôs to a point whenever she sees us she complains that I‚Äôm not doing enough that I need a better job and for him to not be doing everything. But we make equal amount and are also working on our sobriety. She saw him getting on methadone as something I made him do. She wanted him to withdrawal at her house with her. I just honestly don‚Äôt know. He says oh don‚Äôt take what she does out on me. But it‚Äôs annoying. His grandma tells this girl her opionions and probably makes me sound like a shit girlfriend and I hate it. And me and his grandma aren‚Äôt even friends let alone her commenting on my pictures. She has pictures of him with her from years ago all over her house and NONE of me and him. And it hurts. Whenever I talk she just cuts me off, she goes against what I say and always wants to just give us advice that‚Äôs just so not realistic. She really thinks I‚Äôm shit for him and I know it. She makes that beyond obvious. It hurts because me and her were really close In the beginning and she was happy because I brought him out of his depression and drinking at the time and made him happy. I also had an apartment and my daughter then and that was before drugs fucked everything up. But now we are sober, working part time and maintain a nice apartment and we are trying to make plans for the future. I just can‚Äôt help but kind of feel betrayed. She helps him with cars and insurance and she‚Äôs been a huge help to us but really him because it involved both of us. It always gets thrown in our face as well. I‚Äôve just grown distant because she looks down on me. I hate it because anyone on my side (basically just my mom) can see how much I do for him and love him so much. But it‚Äôs like his grandma sees me as taking him away from her. But it‚Äôs her. Ugh. I‚Äôm typing so much but still have left a lot of points out, but damn . If we have a kid in the future I just hate the idea of her not even treating me nice or considering all the things I‚Äôve done and continue to do for him and the nerve of her letting this girl think she has a chance with my boyfriend by telling her things about our relationship that are based on her grandiose ideas her grandson can do no wrong and I‚Äôm just a bad influence on him. And her trying to tell him about how much she cares and misses him as well as she‚Äôs successful. It‚Äôs a huge slap in the face and I feel really betrayed as well as questioning wanting to start a family with someone like her. His younger sister dosent like me either and won‚Äôt add me on Facebook but is friends with this girl on there as well as his ex of 6 years... I‚Äôm an awkward person honestly and I read people good and can tell when I‚Äôm not liked and it makes me withdraw more so I‚Äôve thought I probably just come off as cold and unfriendly but it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm actually paranoid that she‚Äôs judging me or comparing me to his ex and I just sit and imagine what his gram has told his sister about me and how they probably just think I‚Äôm some weird ass bitch that they think he could do better. I‚Äôm also skeptical because my daughters father(and family members) were all so close but when things ended they turned on me and it really hurt me so much because I got close with them and it was like a second family to me and then just got so hurt... I‚Äôve never ever felt close to my boyfriends family like I was with them and just feel shitty because I don‚Äôt want to bring our baby into the world and have there be tension I want to make sure I don‚Äôt mess up and I want our kid to grow up with a close family. I wish I could try discussing how I feel with them but his grandma is honestly too self centered in a lot of ways and just wants to hear herself talk and idk how that would work and his sister is younger like 20 and she just kinda reminds me of girls that bullied me in school. Like I‚Äôm really awkward and hate it and Then me knowing I‚Äôm being antisocial makes me act even more distant and quiet. I hate it. And I don‚Äôt wanna drink or do drugs to try and be fun cuz I used to do that and I just can‚Äôt drink anymore I wish I could cope with myself and just be outgoing and talkative but I feel like it‚Äôs just hard especially when she‚Äôs snobby.

If anyone thinks its better suited for another thread just let me know.

Im quitting smoking weed and I am going through withdrawal on the more severe end of whatever withdrawal you can have for marijuana. I feel sort of silly posting this here because I feel like weed isn't a very serious addiction. I was hoping others who have gone through this could relate or share their experiences with me.

I am 23 years old and I started smoking weed when I was 13. I was on and off doing it every day for periods over the next few years. But I have been a daily user for about 5 years straight now. I can hardly remember not smoking weed regularly.

I never thought I was addicted because I thought that wasn't actually possible, and I never smoked to go to work or school until the last year or so. My ex bf tried to get me to stop and was the first to ever point out it was sort of a problem. I was initially open to it but very quickly went in denial and acted like it wasn't as issue at all.

I am also an engineering student, and because of covid I am doing school from home. This made it really hard to not smoke weed like, all day non stop. It really impacted my studies last semester, but otherwise I have been really happy and in a good place mentally. My current bf who has been my best friend for years before we got together said he wanted to quit and asked me to do it with him. Since the last time I tried I have been kind of thinking about it and wanting to. I wasn't getting a positive experience out of being high anymore and I knew I was using it to avoid problems, so I figured if not now then when? I never planned to be a daily user for my whole life and had no interest in it being a part of my life to this extent for that long, and it's been long enough.

So now I am about 2 ish weeks in to not smoking, and I caved and hit a bowl last night because I was having a tough week for no reason and didn't think it was a big deal.

My boyfriend who is quitting with me was a really casual user so I don't think he fully understands what I am going through and I feel really alone. A lot of things I have been going through I didn't realize were connected to withdrawal until I did some googling today because I wasn't sure what was happening.

I expected some irritability and wanting to smoke, and some trouble sleeping. I figured that would come with breaking any habit you have had for 6 years, but I didn't expect to go through what I am now. I didn't fully realize I was struggling with an addiction until I stopped.

I haven't slept one full night. Even when I am so tired I can't stand up and I lay in bed in the dark with my phone on the other side of the room, and it takes like 2 hours to sleep. I wake up at least once every night for an hour or more.

I can't eat anything and I have lost a lot of weight. Im a pretty thin girl at peak health, but I can tell my ribs are poking out more and I never used to be able to see them on my chest. I really, seriously have not been eating. I don't mean to, I just never feel hungry or want to eat even if the food is put in front of me.

I am waking up with headaches a lot and they aren't severe but last throughout the day.

Im sweating like crazy which isn't something I normally do. Even when i'm cold, I am sweating like A LOT. I get bad chills too, even when I crank the heat.

I have no motivation, less than I did when I smoked which is saying a lot. I can't focus on school work.

Im irritable and cranky. I want to isolate myself all the time.

I have symptoms of physical anxiety frequently but no anxious thoughts to provoke it.

The worst part by far is feeling depressed. Really depressed and really out of left field and it started shortly after I quit. I have been really good at recognizing invasive thoughts and not giving them any power. But I keep describing this feeling as ""low battery,"" because I can't smile.

24/F
so I‚Äôve always loved xanax.  I‚Äôve taken them for years, but have just binged on a few bars over a weekend every once in a while.  It was never a problem until about a year or so ago my dealer asked if I wanted to buy a bulk order for a discount.... so I had this enormous personal stash of xanax &amp; it got out of hand very fast.  Xanax has always felt like an upper to me.  Makes me feel talkative, productive, organized, I plan things, clean things, did well in school- almost like I‚Äôm manic, but all the while completely high on xanax.  And it‚Äôs all great &amp; fun.. until it‚Äôs not. I have very little memory of those few months I was taking xanax everyday, upwards of 4-5 bars a day (please note they were street pills and not real script so not as strong...yes I‚Äôm aware of how dangerous it is to take fake pills).  After my family noticed, my workplace noticed, I wrecked my car, and realized myself I needed help- I was hospitalized &amp; detoxed.  After that, I was (almost) clean for a whole year, minus a few slip ups.  However recently, within the last few months I‚Äôve gone back to binging on a few bars on the occasional weekend, except this time I have to hide it from my boyfriend- who is aware & was with me through my past problem.  The past 2 weekends I‚Äôve been taking a half a bar here & there while drinking or smoking so that my boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt notice/see the difference that I‚Äôm actually high on xanax &amp; not weed/just alcohol.  Again I‚Äôve been incredibly productive, made plans with friends, signed up at a gym, and had a blast of a weekend.  It feels so good, but I know that if I keep this up, it will lead down a path I‚Äôve been down before, and I don‚Äôt want to do that.  My boyfriend is bound to notice because I haven‚Äôt been able to remember simple things like if we got in bed together the night before.  I know I‚Äôm headed down a dark dark path and I don‚Äôt want to but I have no idea how to stop. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Edit: I guess you could technically say that I know exactly how to stop... but I don‚Äôt want to.  So my question really is - how do i make myself WANT to stop?",10,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7265012}"
2021-01-25 11:11:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l4qyu8/what_should_the_foundation_of_my_sobriety_be_if_i/,What should the Foundation of my Sobriety be if I don't believe in God?,"I graduated from a year-long faith based program. I didn't grow up Christian, but once I got into the program it became clear to me that if I was going to beat this thing, I needed to base my sobriety on SOMETHING. Everyone else around me was using God/Jesus, so I tried that too. 

I tried that for a year, the year I was in the program. And then I went off to work for the same organization that runs the program, where I was still surrounded by Christians, many in recovery and having been through the same program. The whole time, I questioned my faith. Didn't really have anything to base it on. Just kind of pretended and forced myself to try and believe. I prayed with others, talked with others about faith, did devotions, went to Church, talked about my Christianity and my feelings about God. But I've never truly, deep down BELIEVED. I just really wanted to, because I thought I had to in order to make it through this. Some people hear others' stories about hearing from God, getting the addiction stripped away from them by God, crying out to Him in their darkest, lowest moment and getting an answer. And they hear those stories and use that to believe in God themselves. I tried that, but that's not enough for me. I guess I'm the type of person who would need to feel/see/hear it for myself before I can believe.

So now, here I am. A family death recently sent me spiraling into a battle with not only grief, but an existential crisis and a psychotic episode as I once again entered active drug use. I stopped going to work because I can't work like this. I still have my job, but only because they're very understanding and hope I get the help I need. But what help do I need? Where do I go from here?? If I don't have the needed faith in God, what else could I make the foundation of my sobriety? I need to pick something that actually works for me. Some people, many of whom you'll find in the rooms of NA/AA meetings, choose their ""Higher Power"" to be something other than God. Whatever keeps them sober. I've heard people say you can pick anything. A door knob, even. How the fuck does that keep them sober? How is that ""greater than yourself?"" 

Some choose to belief simply in the power of the Universe. Okay, that's greater than myself for sure. But why should that keep me sober? The universe does not give a shit about me. It doesn't care whether I live or die today. Maybe a loving God would, but that didn't work for me. I'm not sure that placing my faith in the power of the universe would work either.

Some people place their faith in themselves. I sure as hell can't do that. I'm powerless, I already know that. I have no will-power against my addiction. So that's a no.

What else is there? You can't expect me to believe that every person who's ever gotten sober and stayed sober was a Christian, or believed in the sobering powers of the universe. So what did they believe in that worked for them? Maybe it could work for me. But you never hear about those people. That's why I'm on here asking, what else is there? Maybe some of you are like this. If the traditional method of faith-based sobriety did not help you, what did?",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46698987}"

i am 20 years old and have been kind of struggling with addiction for years thought its not physical addiction but more mentally. ever since being 15 years old and doing my first ever substance (mdma) i just binged on drugs whenever i could. i've lost so much money and friends because of it and i can't help but do it again and again. i will take whatever i can get my hands on whether it's speed or heroin or meth or benzos - i really couldn't care less but recently i've been craving opiates like crazy and after picking up h i realized i wanted something stronger. something that would fuck me up even more so i've been trying fo sind someone that sells fent but i'm from europe and it's not as easy to get my hands on it so i'm waiting. 
since i don't have a job right now and no income i don't have any money for drugs and its been so hard honestly i sometimes could not sleep at night because of the cravings.
it just honestly sucks and i don't know what to do because i'm v sure that this obsession with always finding something harder to fuck me up even more will  make me end up dead and the worst thing is i don't even care anymore. i've been struggling with an eating disorder as well as a personality disorder and depression and anxiety for roughly 8 years now and i just can't get myself to find someone to help me. so i'm using and abusing uppers to satisfy my eating disordered thoughts because i won't eat for days and then faint while showering or while just walking or standing up too quickly. i've lost so much weight and for the first time in my life i am seeing it because usually when i did loose weight i just didn't notice because of my body dysmorphia. my boyfriend and family have noticed my weightloss and for some reason i just see it as motivation to become even more skinny and unhealthy. its just fucked honestly. my body's fucked. last time on a 5 day long nonstop speed binge (the speed being 87% pure and being the craziest shit i've ever tried) i got up one day in the train to get off at my station and my heart just kept beating so irregularly and almost feeling like it wasn't beating but more of a vibrating feeling and it hurt so bad. 
if anyone is still reading i thank you for letting me share this and i hope you're somewhere out there feeling good - or at least somewhat better than i am. sending love, always

Off of a gross otc stimulant drug that I wish I never would have found out about.

But tonight is different. I really realized this time that I don't want to do this stuff anymore. I don't want to suffer like this. Im 18 years old, have an amazing talent for music, and a good soul. But I'm in mental torment over this drug I've quit and relapsed on time and time again.

I don't know why but I always convince myself, ""Yeah well just one more time and i'll be done.""

I know it's so cliche but I've become a broken record.

And now I'm sitting here questioning my whole life listening to fix you by coldplay.

Just praying to god that he guides me out of this dark hole I've been in.

I feel it coming soon. That he is going to lift me up and allow me to be happy and sober.

I have to stay optimistic. But I somehow let myself spiral downhill. It really affects my self esteem so much. I need to rid of this f\*cking demon from my life for good.

And all the other drugs I've been consuming. I know caffeine, weed, and nicotine might not be seen as an intense addiction but they are for me.

Tommorow I just need to wake up and be serious this time. I'm tired of fighting myself. I want to be friend. Not my enemy. And I know I will. I just keep chasing my dreams of music, working, and staying positive.

But at the same time I'm pissed at myself.

It's hard to be easy on myself when I cause this.

But I just need to accept that I'm human and stuff like this happens to so many other people. I'm not alone. And so I came on here. Because I just really need some support. Even if it's just online. I work too much to be able to go to an AA meeting and inpatient rehab never worked for me. So I'm going to just do things the good ol fashion way. Give it all to god and let him work through me.

Because I'll tell you one thing. Drugs are the devil.

You have to know it!

I'll give you my word. And that's all I got.

Today I will stop using every addictive drug invented in the past or in the future.

Clear body=Clear mind

I promise I will be clear in body and mind for the following 10 000 days.

I'm setting my Calendar to remind me to post my prewritten posts here on these days:

Day 10 ""2 February 2021""

Day 100¬† ""3 May 2021""

Day 1000 ""20 October 2023""

Day 10 000 ""10 June 2048""

My rules:

¬†AFTER day 10000 if I have over 100 million dollars on my Swiss savings accounts I will buy the biggest and meanest Sativa joint ever. Delivered by a drone on my rooftop in my swimming pool. No joke.

Let's complicate my case furthermore.

The only way for me to start smoking again is only if some Redditor responds to my post on my 10000 day with ""knowit 10000 days"". The Redditor that will respond first with that phrase will have the chance to share the most expensive joint and also party for a full year for free with me.¬†

Also that Redditor will have the choice not to smoke with me. In that case, I'm not smoking this shit ever again. But that Redditor can still take the chance to party for a year. Yay.

My word!

But until then of course I have to stay clean. Stay completely clean. Not a single drug in my body.¬†

¬†I won't comment or respond to anyone for 10000 days. I won't post anything except my ""prewritten letters to myself"" on their specifically designated days.

¬†Probably nobody will even notice this post anyway. And it doesn't matter unless I bitch out and kneel to this shitty addiction. KNOW IT!",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50721514}"

My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years (we are in our late 20s). He has always been a daily marijuana smoker since he was a teenager, smoking up to 5-6 times a day. This has never really bothered me. Although I don‚Äôt smoke weed, we have used recreational drugs together occasionally at parties/events. However, over the last year, his usage of ketamine has become intense. It‚Äôs caused our relationship to suffer.

He has lied to me about when he was using. I‚Äôve caught him in these lies multiple times over the last year. The worst offenses were when he lied about using on thanksgiving (at a family dinner) and when he lied about using the night we brought home our new puppy. I‚Äôve tried to explain to him multiple times that him lying to me is breaking my trust in him. I‚Äôve resorted to snooping in his stuff to find the ketamine. A couple times, he‚Äôs called me crazy for accusing him of using, but I knew I wasn‚Äôt crazy because I had found his stash. He‚Äôs also tried to excuse his lying by saying that he knew I would react badly and he didn‚Äôt want to start a fight. 

I‚Äôve told him 5-6 times throughout this last year that he needs to see an addictions counselor, get into narcotics anonymous meetings, or do SOMETHING with a professional. He always told me ‚ÄúI think I can beat this on my own.‚Äù Unfortunately, I gave him the benefit of the doubt multiple times hoping he could get clean himself. He would do great for a few weeks but always end up using again.

Most recently (3 weeks ago), I received a call from his coworker saying I needed to come pick him up from work because he was sick and disorientated. I knew right away he had used ketamine. He used it on his break at work and drove back so under the influence that he had no memory of arriving at work or of his coworkers trying to talk to him to figure out why he was sick. His coworkers ended up calling an ambulance and he was taken to a hospital but he lied to the paramedics and no one was aware of his drug use. I was livid that he risked not only his life but innocent lives when he chose to do ketamine and drive. That night, he cried about how embarrassed he was and how he needed to change. I really thought that this was his ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment. Before, I was trying to not be too pushy and hope he would come to the realization that he needs help himself, and I really thought this was the moment. We talked about getting him a counselor or into NA meetings and I really thought he was serious this time. 

Today, he came home from work and I knew he had used again. He initially tried to lie but I told him he needs to stop lying to me because I‚Äôm not an idiot and I can tell when he‚Äôs done ketamine. I told him again that I NEED him to get professional help. He told me that he knows he needs to beat his addiction, but it has to be on ‚Äúhis time‚Äù otherwise it won‚Äôt be right. 

I‚Äôm really at the end of my rope. I love him dearly but this last year has been such a mental load on me that I constantly feel exhausted and on edge. But I don‚Äôt know what to do and I dont know if the relationship should continue. Is giving an ultimatum frowned upon when dealing with addictions? If I leave him, should I just explain it‚Äôs because he needs help that I can no longer provide? Or, if I stay with him, what do I do better? How do I help him? 

Thank you so much for your help. I‚Äôve never had anyone in my life struggle with addiction so I really appreciate any advice. I will also be reaching out to a professional myself to gain some more insight on what I should do.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7830801}"

Do I need help?,"So- shocker- I ( 23/F) come from a long line of addicts( although I know few of them personally).   Maternal grandfather was a prescription addict and according to my very Christian mother very paranoid. My maternal uncle was diagnosed with anxiety and sent to a Christian clinic in his youth to treat this (although I‚Äôve never met him personally). My paternal grandfather was an alcoholic. He left my father when he was very very young so I obviously had no relationship with my grandfather. My paternal uncle was also an alcoholic. My father has struggled with an addictive personality with a varying degree of substances. For me personally I have been a fairly sober person most of my life. I‚Äôd say I was addictive about things in my youth. At 16 I started vaping/smoking. My father (although he had given this up when he met my mother) joined me again in this habit. I started causally drinking with the supervision of my parents at 16. I never knew my limits. I met my boyfriend (now husband) at 18 and got married at 20. He drinks a decent amount but can hold his liquor. Although through no fault of him I had a new Avenue to drink in excess.  When I met my husband at 18 he introduced me to marijuana. As Black Sabbath once said ‚Äúyou introduced me to my mind‚Äù. All the normal behaviors that I now know to be anxiety melted away. I felt myself. A hippie at heart. I didn‚Äôt really drink anymore. Maybe a couple glasses of wine a week. And marijuana was able to make me either quit or lessen the migraine medication I needed to be on. I loved it. Quit honestly it was habitual. I have wanted to help people my whole life and I always thought I would be able to accomplish that through nursing. It‚Äôs finally time for me to apply for nursing school and if I get accepted I‚Äôll have to take a drug test- so for over a month now (and ideally forever) I‚Äôve quit marijuana( cold turkey). It wasn‚Äôt hard to quit other than the habit of it (smoking help me eat, so I smoked breakfast, lunch, and dinner to help).I was not a casual smoker, I smoked over an 1/8 a week.  Since I‚Äôve quit smoking pot my anxiety sky rocketed. I started taking Xanax daily. I feel my anxiety consumes me. The only way to quiet the noise WAS pot. And now it‚Äôs alcohol again like it was in high school. I probably drink a handle of vodka In maybe 2 days if a really paced myself and take varying strengths of Xanax. Fights with my husband are solely prompted by my alcohol use. I have a hard time finding something to ‚Äúclam the noise‚Äù of my life. Nicotine once helped with this, alcohol helped, pot quieted it, and now I‚Äôve traded pot in for Xanax and alcohol daily and I just feel lost. I just want to drown out the noise of life. Is this truly addiction and just trading out vices? Or am I just offending everyone in this groups? Any advice or insights helps. Thank you, and sorry to anyone I might offend.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5527681}"

I was running about close to a month. Anyways I relapsed due to wanting to break away from the methadone clinic. I used diesel for 7 days after not going to the clinic just to give the methadone time to get through and all that. (I was on 45mg for a whole year.) to my surprise and I mean I was really in shock wasn‚Äôt sick. Not once. I even had a sub incase it was gonna be hit.  Made it a whole week. Was totally fine! My 8th day I woke up and just figured, well lemme just go get one more Im in the clear anyways. So my 10$ turned into a whole bunny cause dude was so blitzed he gave me his sac instead. So here we are about 3 weeks out from then. I have stopped yet again and my dude doesn‚Äôt want to. He will not accept any help, he refuses to have willpower to want to better himself despite everything he has been through. He had some decent clean time before all this. But now he is tounge dancing with death. I have probably brought this guy back 3 times just so far in 2021. So anyways, last night I was downstairs cleaning up my daughters play space and getting ready to sit down and relax and he was upstairs pretty much dead in my room. All I heard was him rattling. As fucked up as this sounds, I think I am just so exhausted from feeling like I have to babysit him and having to rehash trauma every time i have had to revive him. I literally was ready to just turn around and walk out. (However with my luck I‚Äôd go to jail.) (and I say this cause I was already locked up for basically reviving someone 3.5 years ago. Good Samaritan law who?) Anyway that‚Äôs how often it‚Äôs happens to him. I of course brought him back. (Also I do not want someone‚Äôs death on my conscience.) However it‚Äôs probably gonna happen again sadly. And I just hope I‚Äôm not around for it. He is very depressed, he also struggles with a type of schizophrenia I‚Äôm pretty sure but of course he has never tried to do anything to treat it. Now here I am trying to keep my own shit together again! I had done this for so long and have lost so much time of my life from this.

I'm a college student who was prescribed adderall in highschool, so I've been taking it for 5 years now. When I first got on it, I was instantly in love, but now, 5 years later, I wish I could hop in a time machine to stop myself from ever getting prescribed it. 

My relationship with it has turned very toxic. I find myself dependent on it for everything from simple productivity tasks like showering to socializing with friends I've had for years. If I'm not on it while interacting with someone, I'm plagued with anxiety, worried that I'm not being sociable or funny enough. On top of that, I can feel the negative impact adderall has on my health.

Alas, the thought of going off of it now scares me. I feel like I've built this glass castle around me the past five years, and the only way I can maintain it is to keep taking adderall. I'm worried the friends I've made on it will stop liking me. I'm worried that I won't be good enough in the things I do. Lately I feel like all I do is worry. I worry about what life would be like off of the meds. I worry about what life would be like if I continued on the meds.

As smooth as they were, the last word ‚Äúaddict‚Äù caught in my mouth wrong and caused me to slightly choke on it. You would‚Äôve missed it if you weren‚Äôt listening closely, but I heard it and it made me shift uncomfortably in my plastic chair. I went on to share about my day and cut myself off quickly as I got a glimpse of the clock hanging on the back wall. Only five minutes left in the meeting, people were probably starting to get antsy. 

The meeting wrapped up pretty quickly and we ended with the typical serenity prayer, each one of us reciting the words by heart. I spent a few minutes helping the group tidy up the room and then made my way out of the dingy church basement, into the stiff and frigid air of another winter in New York. Nothing was out of the ordinary about the night, not yet at least. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fucking freezing out‚Äù I muttered to myself as I slipped into the drivers seat of my outdated, white Jeep. I cranked the heat up as far as it would go and rubbed my hands together while letting out one final ‚Äúdamn, it‚Äôs cold‚Äù, then put the truck in reverse and made my way out of the massive church parking lot. This church had become my second home in the last two months. I had been in recovery for just over three years, but there was something about the winter time that always made the cravings to use drugs so much more intense. I thought about this for a moment and let my mind wander. Why was that? What was it about the cold winter months that made me want to slip back into the hell hole of active addiction? Nothing came to mind, I kept driving. 

Somewhere along the twenty minute drive back home it had started to snow. I didn‚Äôt even notice it at first but before I knew it, I couldn‚Äôt see ten feet in front of me. It was coming down in thick sheets, easily overwhelming my windshield wipers and causing me to squint to try and see where I was driving. I was probably just six minutes from my apartment but something inside of me told me to exercise some caution and pull over. It wasn‚Äôt exactly a feeling, moreso a voice that echoed from my brain all the way down to the very pits of My Stomach. I shook it off without much thought. Carefully, I guided my Jeep onto the side of the road and flicked on my hazards. I peered out through the window in the spots Where the snow had melted off and saw that I wasn‚Äôt the only one who had made this quick decision. Numerous cars had also veered off the main road and now sat waiting with their hazards blinking on and off for the snowfall to slow. I figured it might be a few minutes so I lit up a smoke, cracked the window just a tiny bit and exhaled a massive cloud into the cold night air. The falling snow caught my attention and for a moment I was transfixed, mesmerized by its steady downfall. It was almost hypnotic the way each snowflake twirled steadily downwards and found it‚Äôs resting place on the now powder-coated street. So sure of itself and where it was going. ‚ÄúMust be nice‚Äù, I thought. I smiled and took another long drag of my smoke. For a very brief moment, I felt almost giddy at how peaceful something as simple as snowfall could now make me feel, three years deep into sobriety. Things were actually pretty damn good. 

Just as I was preparing to find a new snowflake to follow on its downward journey, someone knocked harshly on my passenger side window. Startled, I opened it just a tiny bit to get a better look at whoever was on the other side. 

‚ÄúWillow? What‚Äôs up bud, long time no see huh?I recognized your truck.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. How could I not have realized where I was? The thick coat of new snow blanketing my Jeep windows had made it difficult to place where I had pulled over. But now, with the window rolled down just a crack, my brain began to piece together just exactly where I was. The run-down house with the powder blue shutters stood out now, even through the blinding sheets of falling snow that fell around it. The crooked mailbox with the screw sticking out of the top, number eight, stood tall in the growing mound of snow on the ground. I knew exactly where I was. This was my old dealers house and my old dealer was standing just outside my window.

I had made it such a point too avoid this street. I had worked so hard to erase this house from my memory. Even though it was the quickest way home from the church where my meetings were held, I always took the longer detour to avoid this exact situation. There were just too many memories attached to this place. It was the first place I used in and the last place too. Come to think of it, the majority of my times using had been at this exact house. We had been friends, my old dealer and I. Close friends and partners in crime. I had watched people overdose and die at this house. I myself had overdosed and almost died at this house. 

I swallowed hard and mustered up a half-smile. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up old friend? And what the hell are you doing out in this snow?‚Äù

If there was any hesitation or fear in my voice, my old buddy didn‚Äôt catch on. He took my question as an invitation and jiggled at the door handle. I glanced at my reflection in the car mirror. The darkness made only my eyes visible and I stared deep into them for a brief moment. ‚ÄúTell him you have to go. Tell him you have to go and drive home. Now‚Äù My thoughts were racing but this one was firm. Even so, another, slightly softer voice whispered in response. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been three years, this is fine. Stop being so dramatic and let the poor guy in.‚Äù I shook my head ever so slightly and glanced back through the window. My old friend shook the snow off of his jacket and laughed. I had missed him. I clicked the button on my left to open the car door and he quickly jumped inside. 

‚ÄúWow, Willow. It‚Äôs really been too long. You look really, really good. You must be doing pretty well huh?‚Äù, his voice was shaky from the cold.

‚ÄúThanks Robbie, I am doing good. Coming up on three and half years in a few months. It‚Äôs been a roller coaster but I think I‚Äôm finally starting to get it.‚Äù 

Robbie looked at me for a second too long and it made me shift uncomfortably in my seat again, like I had done just an hour before in the meeting. Somewhere deep inside my stomach I could feel something stirring. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good to hear man. Yeah, really good to hear.‚Äù Robbie was genuine in his reply, that much I knew. But there was still something off, something about the cadence of his words that made me shiver. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt want to keep you for too long, I‚Äôm sure you have to get home. I‚Äôm out here waiting for a customer to drop by and he said he was just around the corner so I came out. You know how it is. Or you remember how it is. Sorry.‚Äù We both laughed uncomfortably. I could tell he didn‚Äôt know how to act around me. ‚ÄúWell, do you mind if I wait until he shows up? Should be any minute and then you can get out of here. We can split a smoke, yeah?‚Äù He was so innocent in his words. 

I nodded my head yes, slowly. I felt like something was beginning to take me over. Some part of me began to realize the significance in his words. He was waiting for a customer, which meant, he had drugs on him right this very second, probably a decent amount too. I looked him up and down quickly and silently guessed at where he might be stashing it this time. Pocket? No. Probably his sock. My stomach began to do flips. 

‚ÄúA smoke sounds good.‚Äù I said blankly. I pulled two out of my almost empty pack and tossed one of them into his lap. He scooped it up quickly, lit it and inhaled a deep and deliberate breath out the window. It was silent for a moment, as each of us fell into some sort of nostalgia. We had done this, sat in the front seat of my truck, smoking, waiting, so many times before. 

‚ÄúWhat are people paying for that shit nowadays, anyway?‚Äù, my voice croaked out awkwardly. 

‚ÄúOh man, you don‚Äôt even wanna know. But you know your prices are always cut in half. I‚Äôve never treated you like a normal customer, you know that.‚Äù

My head was starting to spin and for a moment, I thought the snow stopped, but it was just my mind playing tricks on me. Was he tempting me? 

‚ÄúYeah you‚Äôve always been real good to me, Robbie. I gotta give you that.‚Äù I paused there and glanced sideways at what his expression was but it was too dark in the truck to clearly make out. I sucked in a sharp breath of my smoke and let it escape through the crack in the window. Could I escape just as easily as the smoke could drift out this window? I knew I could, but is that what I really wanted? My addict brain was running a million miles a minute at this point. Every nerve ending in my
Body was burning with the same impulse, the same insane drive to just reach out for one, tiny taste. I might be crazy, but I swear I could hear this faint whispering, egging me on, tempting me. Before I even knew what was happening, it was already over. ‚ÄúRobbie, my dear, old friend....you have any extra?‚Äù 

Robbies demeanor immediately softened and the weight of his body relaxed into the seat of the car. A wide, toothy smile spread across his face, still flecked with melted snow. ‚ÄúI always got extra for you, Will.‚Äù 

And just like that, we broke out into a routine that we had done hundreds of times together before. Pull out a hard CD case from my center console, break out the brown powder into a few thin lines with an old credit card, roll up two dollar bills into neat little cylinders. I knew this wasn‚Äôt Robbies usual ‚Äúmethod‚Äù of using his drugs, but I was three years clean, my tolerance was down near zero. He knew this as well as I did and he knew that any other route of administration would likely kill me. So it was up the nose for both of us tonight, out of thoughtful consideration of course.

I watched him quickly inhale his two lines. My body shook with anticipation and I licked my dry, chapped lips. Just a few more seconds....

Robbie handed the CD case over to me followed by the rolled up dollar bill.  I positioned it carefully up to my left nostril and without a second thought, I snorted up the brown powder, once in the left and then twice more in the right. The dollar bill dropped
From my hand and fell to the car floor, right beneath the gas pedal. I let the long-anticipated feeling spread over me and engulf me whole. Sweet, sweet release. I smiled and side-eyed Robbie and then let out a euphoric laugh. God, it had been too long. 

‚ÄúThe first one back after a long time is always the best, man. I‚Äôm fucking jealous. Just be careful, watch your breathing. Three years clean is a looooong time.‚Äù I watched as his mouth formed a perfect 0 shape as he formed the word ‚Äúlong.‚Äù It made me chuckle again. Just as he finished the word, two bright headlights pulled up behind my stationary Jeep. ‚ÄúShit, Wills. I gotta go, customer just pulled up. Listen, just promise me you‚Äôll watch yourself tonight okay? Make sure you don‚Äôt go nodding out for too long.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, I promise. Thanks.‚Äù I was already beginning to sink deep into the warm and familiar embrace of an opiate-induced nod. I managed to get a few more words out, ‚ÄúThanks, old friend. I‚Äôll see you around.‚Äù 

Robbie hopped out of the car just as quickly as he had come. I clicked the lock button again and lit up another smoke, watching the snow fall again through slanted eyes. Somewhere far away, I thought I could hear someone laughing. A deep and satisfied laugh, pleased with itself. I was drifting now, sailing off towards the kind of sleep I had been missing for just over three years. The sound of soft snowfall echoed around me, signaling that the snow had finally slowed and it was now safe to drive home. But I wasn‚Äôt listening anymore. My hair fell around my face like liquid amber, cradling it‚Äôs form. I wasn‚Äôt listening, not anymore.

I awoke to a searing pain that exploded through out my whole body. My puffy, swollen eyes slowly opened and I could almost make out the shape of growing flames, licking at my bare feet and toes. The smell of sulfur and rot assaulted my senses and I gagged back bile. After a minute or two, I couldn‚Äôt hold it any longer and I spewed vomit all over myself. I slowly lifted my head, vomit still dripping down my chin. There was nothing around me but vast and never-ending emptiness. A desert of sand that rippled in odd formations and cryptic patterns. There were small fires distributed throughout the landscape that ebbed and flowed erratically. I took a panicked breath inwards and suddenly the surrounding fires rocketed upwards. I let my breath out, the fires settled back down. Another sharp breath in, the fires burned to life and soared upwards again. Another breath out, they dwindled back down again. I shook my head in disbelief. The fires were moving with my breathing. With every breath in, they grew and with every breath out they cowered back down again. 

‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù, my voice echoed throughout the vast and burning landscape, only to be thrown back at me in a disconcerting and unnatural echo. Something was not right. Suddenly, a voice began to speak. It did not come from any particular direction but instead, from inside of me, if that was even possible. 

‚ÄúIs it that hard to figure out, my child?‚Äù, it boomed. ‚ÄúFor a smart girl, it‚Äôs taken you quite some time to catch on.‚Äù As the voice trailed off it broke out into a deep and satisfied laugh. I knew that laugh, I had heard it before. Terror began to engulf my mind and body. I began to uncontrollably shake. 

From somewhere deep in my peripheral vision, a form began to take shape. The surrounding fires fed it slowly, until it was hovering at least eight feet above the ground. Each feeding fire stayed connected to it through a long, thin, fiery tether. It advanced towards me with such speed that I instinctively crawled backwards in  a deep and raw type of fear I had never felt before. The dark form loomed above my crouching body. It was made entirely of darkness, with no discernible features. It was a void. And as I focused on it more intently, I began to feel it pulling me towards it, sucking me up into never ending blackness.

‚ÄúI have been waiting for you, my faithful and loyal servant. All of this time, you‚Äôve been serving me so, so well. You lost your way for some time, but I knew you‚Äôd find a way back into servitude, to me, your all-powerful Master,
Your all-knowing God. I‚Äôve spoken to you, laughed with you and endlessly called to you and now finally, you join me. I have had rights to you since you were born. You were always mine, you were always to end up here, my sweet Child.‚Äù The voice boomed and echoed from the depths of my very own body. My cells vibrated as they hissed at me. The surrounding fires began to grow. 

‚ÄúAll of this time, you‚Äôve served me so well. You‚Äôve always been destined to join me, there was only escaping it for a short time before I called you back into the fires.‚Äù 

My fear and despair were growing so quickly that I was loosing the ability to hold my body up under its own weight. The only sounds that were able to escape my parched mouth were a few pathetic croaking sounds. I was loosing it, fast. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand...‚Äù the sound of my
Own voice surprised me. I could feel the form towering above me growing in its impatience and hatred towards me. I had never felt So small. It reached a bony and decrepit finger out from under its cloak of darkness and pressed it into the center of my forehead. ‚ÄúLook, my stupid and silly Child. Look and you will understand.‚Äù 

I was instantly transported back through a swirling mirage of past experiences, back through time. I grasped at the fading images Around me, desperate to hold onto one of them long enough to take me away from wherever I currently was. I pleaded with the flashing faces before me for forgiveness,
For redemption, for some way out of this,  far away from the creature made of darkness that awaited me in the fires. 

My vision slowed to a steady stop. Before me, I watched a version of myself in a cramped room, sitting with Robbie. My old friend. He was breaking me out my very first line of heroin. He emptied each baggie onto a glass table Methodically and handed me a perfectly rolled Dollar bill. As I watched this scene go down just as it really had, I silently screamed, begging this past version of myself to stop and run, GET OUT NOW! In the vision, I hesitated before I made any other movements towards the broken out lines on the desk. I rememebed this moment well, how I had hesitated and struggled with this decision so deeply. And just as it looked like I was about to get up and leave the room, the creature made out of darkness appeared in the vision, just over my Left shoulder. It slid silently to my side and rested its bony fingers on both of my shoulders, it stroked my hair. And it began to whisper. After a few seconds, just like that, I watched myself pick up the dollar bill and inhale the drugs deeply into my nostrils. It was too late now, it had me.

In defeat, I cried and buried my face in my
Burning, raw hands. The burns were spreading across my whole body now, pinching and twisting at my skin. The visions and faces swirled around me faster but I didn‚Äôt care anymore, now I understood. I opened my eyes To the endless desert of burning fires and slowly looked up to see the creature made from darkness hovering just in front of my face.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been you, this whole time. You who whispered it was okay to try, you who filled me with such sick and obsessive thoughts, you who drove me to insanity just to use again, you who made me pull over in the snow, you who pushed me to abandon my morals and my inner self. It‚Äôs been you, constantly whispering in my ear, calling me here.‚Äù 

The creature was expressionless and motionless. After what seemed like an eternity, it finally lifted its bony arms from beneath its cloak and pulled back a thick layer of inky darkness from within its own body. I picked myself up from the scorched and burning ground and without any further hesitation, I walked straight into the void.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49120343}"

We have been long distance for the past year because he started going to medical school. I think it has been going on for a few weeks. He has no idea I know about this.

While I have never seen him do it or found paraphernalia, I now have extensive chat logs where he talks in great detail about crack and how to get as high as possible, etc. I have no experience with addiction, and frankly had no idea this was going on until yesterday. I am still in complete shock. For the first 24 hrs I was trying to rationalize why a person who does not smoke crack would be active in forums for people who smoke crack and post about how delicious it looks and give suggestions for how to improve the high. I have now landed, and the only explanation is that he himself consumes it. Or is there any other explanation? **Am I jumping to conclusions?**

I know he used to take some kratom a few years ago when he lived here, but this is next level. What am I supposed to do? I don't even know how to bring it up. I think he will deny it, and I really don't want to bring up the forums as it is the only way I can see how he is progressing since he is clearly lying to me. I want to help but I also don't want him to shut me out. Do I just tell his parents? He is living abroad and is quite isolated. Will he even stop if I ask him? Will confronting him make things worse? I have no idea how to proceed.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.737358}"

Don't want to go cold turkey just yet,"Just some background.  I don't vape, but I started taking nicotine lozenges to help me concentrate at a stressful job about a decade ago.  When it was at its peak, I was taking the equivalent of about 40mg (roughly 40 cigs?) a day.  It isn't so bad now, but in the last 3 years I average about 14 mg a day.

Recently, I decided to taper off, and have lowered myself to 9mg in the last week or so.  Even this feels like a hurtle, as the first day on 9mg was fine but today I feel mostly tired and unmotivated, which isn't good b/c I traded my last stressful job for an even more stressful and technical one.  I feel like I always need to be 100% and can't be if I am going thru withdrawal.

The biggest issue is that I feel like I am doing this alone.  No one in my inner circle understands.  My social support system when it comes to such things is nonexistent.  and a lot of hotlines I briefly research seemed geared towards ""heavier"" drugs, or simply will forward you to a specialist that I don't have time to visit.

I realize that there are people here who are battling much worse addictions, but I feel like I'm running out of options.  Anyone who has successfully tapered off of nicotine (or any product containing it), what are your strategies?

Sorry for the soapbox.  Just have a lot to get off my chest.  Thanks for listening

He is still going to rehab and I am still hopeful he will make a full recovery, but I don‚Äôt have any high expectations for what comes next.

Six months clean. After so long he made it, but even now, sitting on the bed in his room, he understood how even after that long period of sobriety it was not easy to live. He heard a voice from the kitchen. ""I'm going out with some friends for dinner, sorry if I leave you here to eat all alone"", it was his girlfriend. Maybe it didn't seem like that at the time, but she really helped him a lot in that period. ""Then have fun, see you later!"", The door closed and the air stopped resounding with her wonderful voice. He went to the kitchen and made himself ramen in a few minutes. He was a bit sad in that moment, he had been for months now, but he tried not to think too much about it and carry on his goal. He nibbled slowly in front of the TV, with a blanket over his shoulders. He appreciated it, however simple that moment was, and probably a little melancholy as well. After an hour and a half he got back on the bed, this time laying down, with the lights off. He took a deep breath of the warm air of the room and felt embraced by that relaxing darkness, and closed his eyes. 
Suddenly he felt something holding him stuck on the mattress, immobilizing him. The relaxing darkness turned into a cold, viscous, heavy darkness, and a voice spoke to him. ""And so ... we meet again"". He knew that voice really well and panic gave him a strong squeeze in the stomach. ""Why are you here?"" He whispered. ""You know, maybe you know even better than me because I'm here,"" the voice replied. ""N-no"", ""Hm, what'sthe problem? Do you fear me now?"". A long silence followed with no answer. ""Go away."", although his voice didn't seem convinced, deep down he really wanted that voice to fade immediately. He felt pressure on his arm, still full of scars. ""Ugh. Aren't you tired of staying here quiet all day long while your girlfriend is having fun with others?"", the voice came close to his face. ""Stop it. They're just her friends, there's nothing wrong with that..."". He heard a small laugh ""Friends do you say? Have you ever seen them? How do you know that she just dates another guy?"", ""She would never do that ..."", he was interrupted. ""Still, she goes out almost every day now, right?"". Even though those words were clearly false, they seemed almost reasonable to him at the time. ""And then who would like someone like you?"", Tears came to his eyes. ""I know why you're here, but please don't"". ""And why not? It seemed to me that you liked it"", the tears fell; ""Shut up!"". ""Is that what you want? Think of yourself some time ago, wasn't it beautiful?"", Sobs followed. ""I don't want to remember,"" his voice was already exhausted. ""And why not? Come on, don't cry, what I'm telling you is reasonable ..."". ""No"". ""Are you sure? How much do you have to lose?"" ""No I ..."", ""Come on, you have a girlfriend who cheats on you blatantly, and helps you just because she feels sad seeing your situation..."". Those words entered him, broke him. He was silent panting for a few tens of seconds. ""Yes..."". He let himself be pervaded by that voice, while the tears flowed undeterred, he got up and felt guided by that damned demon. That voice took his body, and he couldn't resist it. He left the house, every fiber of his being regretted having said yes, the lights of the cars passed in front of him all blurry. He knew very well where he was going. His body paused for a few minutes, then picked up even faster than before and stopped in a place where the car lights no longer dazzled him. He knew, it was over. He felt a pinch, then closed his eyes and felt that heat devastating him completely again, damn it.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.546558}"
2021-01-22 07:03:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l2mczt/hey_fellow_redditors_im_gonna_write_a_long_one/,Hey fellow Redditors! I'm gonna write a long one here so please bear with me. I really hope I can get some advice from you guys.,"Few things about me first. 

I'm (M) 27, single and never been in a relationship, never been intimate with anyone (still a virgin), never even kissed a girl.

I'm a highly educated professional and earning in the upper six figures. I don't have a lot of friends but the ones I do would describe me as someone who is supportive, kind, generous, charming and a good looking funny guy. My parents are extremely supportive but I hardly share anything with them let alone talk about my addiction.

I am a sex addict or as I'd like to put it ""addicted to masturbation"" and have a few traits of compulsive sexual behavior. This habit of mine started a few years ago and even before I could realize, I uncontrollably went down the rabbit hole. The problem only became worse. I'm not addicted to pornography and hardly ever consume pornographic content while I'm masturbating. I masturbate looking at pictures of celebrities on Google. 

The thing that I'm most worried about apart from my excessive masturbation (4-5 times a day) is my compulsive behavior and the consequent anxiety arising from it. First it was the celebrities on google, then I started saving their pictures in my phone. I started making lists of ""XYZ"" celebrities in ""XYZ"" dress at ""XYZ"" event or ""XYZ"" in Maxim/Vogue photoshoot etc. I would look them up on google and masturbate watching them. It did not end there. I would search all these models and people I know on Instagram and look at their pictures to masturbate. I even started looking at my co workers pictures while masturbating. Sometimes I would look at a picture but couldn't find it anywhere on the internet and would go completely bonkers. It would take away a lot of time which I could have spent on doing something worthwhile. I became so anxious at a point that whenever I would pass a huge billboard and look at a celebrity on it which aroused me, I'd save it in my list, come back home, google it and masturbate to it. My phone would have an infinite number of open incognito tabs Losing my phone made me really mad because I lost all that material I would use to satisfy myself.

My work took a backseat, my relationships were now less important and all I would think about is getting those 5 minutes when I could be alone and touch myself.

I would feel light hearted if I could talk about my fantasies also but it wouldn't be appropriate to share them here on this platform.

Today, I realized that this behavior is not normal and I may be going through some kind of mental illness. I don't think there's anyone out there whom I could share my problem/illness with. I'm not comfortable going to a doctor with this problem because it embarrasses me to the core.

I follow a healthy lifestyle, eat well, sleep for 7-8 hours and work out everyday.

Any help/guidance/support/advise is highly appreciated.

I have a job and I‚Äôm doing well in school I have a boyfriend and friends that I stay in contact w as much as most people would during the pandemic. So basically, my life isn‚Äôt terribly affected by me using it everyday.

I like weed because it‚Äôs a nice thing to look forward to at the end of a day. My mind is more creative and sometimes I think about my problems and find solutions or other perspectives to consider that I never would‚Äôve normally thought of. I‚Äôm bipolar and mostly managed by meds, but when I wasn‚Äôt, smoking would help calm me down when I had urges to hurt myself/others or was just feeling terrible.

The bad sides are that my diet and self control in that regard is much worse when I‚Äôm high. I‚Äôm 150lbs and like 5‚Äô7 (I have some muscle and would consider myself average), but I will probably gain weight if I keep eating like that. I also wonder if having the extra time that I normally spend being high I could workout more, do more schoolwork, social contact, etc.

I know I don‚Äôt want to quit, but what are some strategies or tips I should know when going about reducing my usage? I don‚Äôt have a particular goal in mind yet. I‚Äôm so used to having it as a part of my routine now that idk where to start.

But, what‚Äôs unmanageable is the way you lived your life before you got clean. Ceasing to do drugs doesn‚Äôt only stop you from actually doing drugs, but additionally, your whole life is transformed in incomprehensible ways. Admitting you have a problem is a difficult step. However, acknowledging the issue and taking action steps to resolve it are worlds apart. Once you are willing to do something about the problem you have started recovering. A new way of living.

A wonderful girlfriend,  an awesome dog and a nice big warm house working towards my dream job.

I did drugs with the girl I cheated on my now ex gf with and shot a sex video.  She left me,  I lost my dream job and now I feel as though I have nothing.  I live in my house with some of her possessions (she lives in a few states away now).  I working a shitty dead end job and I hate myself.  I'm trying to get through this depression.  I'm not sure if its just the breakup but also maybe the shame I feel all the time.  The problem is I cant seem to stay off dating apps.  I think i use it to get away from my lonliness.  I don't have many friends out here but I try my best to workout and meditate as much as I can.

I'm seeing a therapist now and Ive had about 8-9 sessions with them.  heres what I think is wrong with me 

&#x200B;

It was my fault that I couldn't control my urges.  At the time I didn't even know I had a problem,  or that I had been a sex addict for about 10 years (I'm in my mid twenties).  

&#x200B;

I think my problem started when I was around 14-15,  I had been exposed to pornography at a very young age (8-9 I think) and I had moved around quite a lot as a child,  so I would make close friends and then have to relocate and start from scratch.  I once lived at a place where I had extremely close friends,  but when I was 14 everything changed and I moved to a location where kids would pick on me for being socially awkward because I didnt know anyone and I felt like an outcast that first year.

&#x200B;

To cope with this pain I would go home and masterbate,  sometimes up to 4 times daily.  This went on throughout middle school,  and when I had my first girlfriend,  we had sex at a very young age (age 15).  After we broke up I had my first hook up,  and I was hooked from that point on.  When I was in college I lost count of how many people I slept with.  It clearly got out of control but I think I've slept with 150-200 women so far, if not more.

My ex boyfriend is a long term drug addict. He doesn‚Äôt prefer hard drugs but stays between pain killers and marijuana. His parents enable his every whim by throwing money at him when he whines about anything regarding life. He did some pretty heavy emotional things to me throughout our 6 year relationship and now that it is over I feel like I‚Äôve been left out to dry.

He wouldn‚Äôt talk to me for the longest time then over New Years we decided to hang out. We had a great weekend with lots of laughs and lots of discussion about our relationship and what went wrong. I found myself not wanting to leave him and go back home. 

Time has gone by and I didn‚Äôt hear from him until last week when he called to ask if I would go away with him for a day to help him get sober. For the first time ever I told him no because I felt like he was using me. He‚Äôs made comments about having all these other women and all these new great friends so I asked why he couldn‚Äôt just ask one of them. He said it was because he couldn‚Äôt tell them anything about his addiction problems. In my mind I thought, why try to start a relationship based on a lie...doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs romantic or platonic. It‚Äôs still a lie. 

So I thought about it for awhile then I called him back and I said I wanted to get back together and that I would help him. Just for him to turn on me and tell me that we could never get back together because of the things I told him during our weekend together. Honest and heartfelt things. 

I just don‚Äôt understand his behavior and I‚Äôm sure as hell not getting an explanation from him. He makes himself sound like he knows everything and is always throwing out the ‚Äútrust me I know‚Äù line. It all just seems like he‚Äôs putting on a fake face to make me crazy or jealous....when in reality I know he‚Äôs writhing in self pity because he is using.

Once upon a time there was a village boy that knew in his heart he was different from the other villagers. He used to spend his time at the shore finding seashells and all manner of fascinating artifact washed ashore. When it came time to become a man of the village the boy built himself a boat from the trees of the island.  He sailed that boat into the vast ocean. For a time he never felt so free.  His sail to the wind he was sure he would discover wonders beyond his homeland and glory beyond his island destiny.  As the days and nights wore on he grew tired. At night he would wrap himself in his sail and float ever on into the blue unknown. Soon enough he became hungry and desperate with doubt.  He knew as long as he stayed warm in that sail he would never find a way home.  Part of him was OK with that, as long as he didn‚Äôt have to shiver through the lonely days and nights.  But another part of him knew he would never get home, or anywhere like it without that sail.  In his heart he knew he believed in land, he was sure he knew what it looked like and that if he saw it he could get there.  Only he could not see it, for miles and miles it was only the deep black blue.  Faith I suppose possessed the boy to unbundle himself from the cozy sail and rig it up to his vessel.  He set course, any course. Day and night he sailed frozen to his bones but resolved and determined.  The relentless sea tested his will to the breaking point. The brutality of the voyage seemed inhumane and he cursed God and creation for his rebellious spirit. Why couldn‚Äôt he just be a village man like his mother and father wanted? Darkness surrounded him and sleep took him over. As he woke the sea had calmed. He rose to the blinding light and looked across the horizon to see a figure jutting out of the water.  It was not a boat or a bird.. it was land! Setting course he made way for the coast full sail.  When he finally landed on the island his family and neighbors were there with baskets of food and open arms.  He could not have imagined a better feeling.  He lived out his life as the master fishermen he had become on the open waters, spending joyful days on the island passing on tales of the sea to the village youth.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.53158754}"

Similarly, there are many factors in the development of an addiction ‚Äî one person might learn to self-medicate for anxiety, depression, or the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder while another addicted person is naturally born with an overactive dopamine-fueled SEEKING system. SEEKING is the first of the primary-process emotions.

All animals, including humans, are emotionally driven to SEEK rewards in the environment, like food, sexual mates, and survival-bestowing plant medications. The SEEKING system is modulated by dopamine and is commonly called the ‚Äòreward‚Äô system, which is a misnomer based on an outdated understanding of the function that dopamine has in the brain.

When this dopamine-based ‚Äòreward‚Äô/SEEKING system is stimulated electrically or chemically, mammals energetically engage with their environment in an exploratory manner; the dopaminergic SEEKING system fills us with euphoric excitement and anticipation of rewards in the environment ‚Äî think of a dog excitedly bouncing around as we walk towards him with his food bowl in our hands.

Those of us who have studied addiction might have heard of experiments in which a rat sits in a cage with an electrical probe implanted in his brain and a lever in front of him. When the rat presses the lever, he triggers an electrical stimulation of the ‚Äòreward‚Äô/SEEKING system via the probe. Rats will continuously press the lever to stimulate this dopamine system until they die.

When I first heard of this experiment, I pictured the rat sitting in his cage in a drug-like, electrically-stimulated stupor, completely ignoring his surroundings in favor of repeatedly stimulating the ‚Äòreward‚Äô system, high on pure pleasure from the constant dopamine release. On the contrary, rats don‚Äôt act doped up; they actually excitedly explore their environment while the ‚Äòreward‚Äô/SEEKING system is being stimulated ‚Äî they even seem to try to search behind the lever (Panksepp, 2012).

Although Panksepp‚Äôs work has been largely marginalized, and many of us have probably never heard the dopamine system called the SEEKING system, the rest of the neuroscientific community is coming around to the perspective of affective neuroscience, and it is now well accepted that the massive dopaminergic system that we previously called the ‚Äòreward‚Äô system is associated with an emotional-motivational state of ‚Äòwanting‚Äô and that entirely different, much smaller neural systems are involved in the actual feelings of pleasure that lead us to ‚Äòliking‚Äô (Berridge, 2016).

Panksepp postulated that animals self-stimulate the SEEKING system not because it feels pleasurable in the way that a wonderful meal is delightful, but because it promotes a powerful internal state of SEEKING that also produces a very special positive feeling that closely resembles how we humans feel when we are full of positive excitement about the good things that are around us in the environment.

To read more, check out the link below. what do you guys think? have you ever heard of the SEEKING system, or have you only heard of the 'reward' system as it relates to dopamine? Are addictive disorders like substance use disorders primarily disorders of chasing pleasurable experiences or a disorder of unlimited desire?",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5951876}"

Hes never said when it started. He actually had a period where everything looked like it was changing and he started doing things he used to do. We thought he was finally going to change and even expected some bumps in the road! But now it seems since december he had fallen off the wagon and is back to stealing money or asking for money every day.

 Im honestly just tired of catching him cutting up lines, hearing him snorting every day or night and him trying to hide whatever whenever anyone enters the room. Anytime I ask if he is on it he will get mad and start raising his voice and verbal attack with name calling or bringing something up that one of us has done. It is so exhausting to keep hearing him deny using! 

 Especially when we show him videos of him nodding off and slurring his words! Ive tried to help him by getting him books like NA and workbooks saying to at least look thru them and see if anything clicks with you. I tried twice to get him into therapy (he asked to be) but then he doesnt go thru with it. Then looking into rehabs and one didnt accept his coverage and now when we catch him snorting he will say he tried to get into rehab but they didnt want to help him. Like he didnt even look into any others.

I love him so much and it sucks seeing him in so much pain. But im tired of constantly trying to be understanding when he just denys everything. The attitude and him constantly saying I dont know what talking about or I missaw what he was doing. Just last night he asked help to find his earphones. I looked with him and after a while said dont know where he put them only for him to say oh no im trying to find my baggie. I understand addiction is a hard cycle and it changes you. I get that but some times just want to ring his neck yelling what the fuck is wrong with you!! 

Anyone else have any similar experiences? Sorry just had to vent!

Edit: I do lose my cool when we agrue and have said names back to him. Ex: he called me a r-tard and i said the only dumbshit here is the one doing drugs. We would go back and forth like this. I know immature and its something trying to improve when things get heated between us.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.79364747}"

Tip 1.

Start smoking CBD flower (It is basically weed that does not make you high like THC does), no one should quit smoking weed in one day. If you do not want to smoke anything at all, I suggest smoking less and less CBD flower every single day, untill you feel comfortable with quitting completely.

Tip 2.

Don't be too hard on yourself, if you want to smoke weed, you should be able to in my opinion, but only once per month or even better a few times a year, in the weekend or on your day off (1 to a few joints), as long as you do not get back to the old habit of smoking it every day. You should be able to enjoy life without having to worry about staying sober all the time. But this only counts if you have the discipline to do this, if you can not live a lifestyle like this I suggest just building off your marijuana use with CBD flower and once you have it under control you can stop smoking it completely.

Stress is the most deathly thing in this world, imagine having to worry about staying sober all day every day, the rest of your life, and the stress that comes with it, and I personally I feel like that is even worse for your health/mental health than drinking and smoking every once in a while

Unfortunately because she was unable to secure housing (she is on disability, as am I, she got kicked out of subsidized housing due to her drug use and is having a hard time finding another apartment she can afford from both HUD and Section 8) and space is limited due to COVID they told her to leave. She is living with me now, except to go to a hotel once every two weeks as my place, also subsidized, only allows guests to stay a full 2 weeks. Saturday my mother found out about it and went off the deep end. Mom and I did family therapy for less than a month and she decided to cut it off as she didn‚Äôt want to do it. I told her my GF isn‚Äôt a bad person just someone with deep emotional scars due to her father raping her as a kid.

What should I do?,"I'm a 31yo male and my dad (62yo) recently expressed interest in using psychedelics with me. Some context: he abused alcohol from age 16 to 37 and used cannabis and other recreational drugs in his younger years. He sobered up when he and my mom divorced and he's been very committed to AA ever since, roughly 25 years in the program. Overall, it's been a great thing for him, but over the years he's expressed some frustrations towards advice that doesn't really resonate with his mental state (i.e. ""just let it go"" when it comes to dealing with negative self talk, etc.)  

I've struggled with mental health issues my whole life, partially related to growing up in a home with an alcoholic, but we have a great relationship now. I was recently diagnosed with a pretty severe case of ADHD and I've completely cut out my alcohol and cannabis use as a result. We're both big meditators and very interested in improving our mental health since we share a lot of the same mental health issues. 

I mentioned to someone else recently in presence of my dad that I use psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD primarily) 2-3 times per year with great success towards reducing suicidal thinking and overcoming persistently negative self-talk. 

About a month later, we were hanging out and he asked me if I'd be comfortable doing psychedelics with him. He said he had done a bit of research (Michael Pollan's How to Change Your Mind, etc.) and was intrigued by it. I'm on the fence because I don't want him to do something that he will regret and I'm not sure how he could use psychedelics without resetting his sobriety clock. On the other hand, I've had some great success personally using psychedelics for self-reflection and overcoming negative self-talk, which is a major thing he struggles with.

How can I help him navigate his decision? Should I try to steer him away from it altogether? I've never had a conversation like this before and I deeply respect what he's been able to accomplish since he entered the program 25 years ago.",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5481854}"

&#x200B;

I need advice from recovered meth addicts or from people who know of anyone.

My brother has been a meth addict for 13 years and he also suffers from schizophrenia (it could be meth-induced schizophrenia, but I'm not exactly sure.) He's been in and out of jail, rehab centers, and mental hospitals. Currently, he's in a rehab center outside of the country because he gets violent at home after smoking meth or craving it. He even tried stabbing my dad with the kitchen knife once. I understand that forcing someone into rehab is the worst solution, but it's really not safe for us to have him around at home. We used to call the police but they made matters worse and he's unwilling to stay in a rehab center or hospital by choice. We care for him dearly and we allow him to stay with us for a few days in Mexico ( where his current rehab center is located). The rehab center allows us to take him out for a few days or call them if he gets violent.

What can we tell him or do to help him recover from his meth addiction? 

I would also like to know what gave you the willpower to recover from it. 

I also live in California, perhaps saying that can help with a response.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7918832}"

I am in a deep dark hole and I fantasize about suicide daily, although these delusions can never be actualised because I have three younger sisters and a son. I couldnt put that pain and misery on them, but this isn't r/depression
So I've managed to kick most of my drug use, especially the bad stuff(but if I get drunk that all goes out the window and I wake up in someone's kitchen 3 days later with no money and no clue where I am) nowadays I won't drink unless I'm in a super 'safe' enviroment

Invited her into my home we had sushi and both enjoyed a movie. Trying to get to know each other, as the night went on and it got late. I learned that she is homeless and she starts crying stating that her family doesn't care about her and how no one is there for her. Having been Almost homeless previously I immediately offered her shelter. she stayed for two nights but as time went on I started noticing mental instability, I started getting curious about her situation and how she got there. 

I never learned her full name till later, but I learned that she comes from a troubled home filled with drama and drug addiction. She went on to tell me that she has three siblings. 

Brother number one is currently working a minimum wage job, brother number two is currently in rehab, and her older sister is a heroine addict and according to her she's in big risk of overdosing because of high amounts she uses. She stated that she doesn't along with her mom and they would fight often. Seems to me she was running away from her problems. Creating one for herself... Im not sure if she is using a hard drug or is mentally unstable but I started noticing mood swings, anger, depression and insecurity. On the third night I asked her that it was time for her to leave due to my roommate coming home respectfully. She broke down on me and threw a tantrum and cursed me out  refused to leave and demanded a lot of money from me. I immediately called a friend over to help keep the peace and be a witness in any crazy scenario to what could of unfolded at that point.

I eventually called her a Lyft and sent her to a motel 6 in Long Beach her hometown with 200 cash to get a room and also hoping that she uses it better her situation even though I doubt that highly.

Before she left I noticed her id and her full name and also struck curiosity into finding out why she is the way she is and seeing If I can help out. Maybe not financially but emotionally its a cold world and I feel for her, mostly because she has her full life ahead. 

I found her mom and older sister on Facebook and was thinking if it would do any good to reach out and try to make contact? or to just possibly let it go and move on?

She hates me because I had to kick her out but I couldn't risk my home for her any longer especially if she has a meth or heroine addiction. I also notice that if she is using it started recently, her skin body showed few to no signs of hard use. 

&#x200B;

What would you do? What is the right thing to do? Should I reach out to her family?

What would be the appropriate approach? 

Im open to all opinions and discussions, Im not a bad person I hate that I feel for everyone going through shit but this one is different something struck me inside to try to help.

So we are setting in her bathroom talking, like we always do.  Our comfortable little ritual that we as sisters, have shared for years.  Me, perched on the counter plucking my eyebrows; she in the tub with the shower curtain closed. Shaving those legs that were ballerina status. Talking about anything and everything that sisters do, laughing at dumb shit that only we would find humorous. 

Out of the blue she says,  ""I need to show you something sis, but you're going to hate me"".  I laugh and say ""nothing you could show me or tell me would ever make me hate you!‚Äù She pauses for what seems an eternity. ""What??  What is it!‚Äù  
And that ‚Äúwhat‚Äù my eyes beheld as she cautiously pulled back that shower curtain,  will be burned into my soul for as long as I live.  This sister of mine, who was dubbed the ""pretty one"", perfect in every way, shape and form. She revealed the secret to me. 
     Her beautiful, naturally tanned FLAWLESS skin that she was blessed with...her lithe, perfect, strong and healthy body that she worked so hard for, was riddled, and I mean RIDDLED with track marks. 
Holes. 
Sores. 
Abbesses.  
Her veins now the color of death, barely visible, the ones I could see anyway. Every inch of her naked body was marked. 
Arms, fingers, legs, feet, toes, breasts, neck. Groin.  
I stared at her body as my mouth dropped to the floor in total disbelief before I could finally look into her eyes. That one shared look between two sisters spoke of a million words. Hers spoke of the shame, the guilt, the PAIN. Mine professed such pity, my deepest sorrow and regret. By far, this was my biggest failure as a human being and as her sister. 
The only words I could muster was ""if mom sees this, it would kill her"".  
With her head held down in complete defeat, she raises her haunted eyes to meet mine and again she asks, but now with this voice of an abused, neglected, lost little girl. That innocent voice Ive memorized by heart,  owned by my sister that I so vividly remember from my yesterdays. As we played side by side, laughed arm in arm. Dreamt out loud of our deepest dreams....Oh little one, what have you done? I start to softly cry and in a barely audible voice I whisper, ""I don't hate you, I hate what you've done to yourself"".  

It all made sense now! The bandaged hands, and the excuses of why they needed to be. Hoodies in July.  Stick thin. Sickly and unwell, afflicted with one made-up condition after another. So many obvious red flags.  My naivet√© is shameful and utterly embarrassing. How on earth could I have been so stupid!

By her sharing her secret with me, she in-turn no longer felt the need to hide her drug use from me. For once again, i was her trusted confidant and knew her deepest, darkest and now the most sinister of sins. 
But the load she took off her shoulders, only to place onto mine with this confession, was immediate; and so fucking heavy. As soon as she got out of the bath, she pulled out her drug kit, loaded a rig, tied off, and slammed a speedball right in front of me.  Like we‚Äôve been at this for years. Not a moments hesitation. No trepidation whatsoever.  I watched with complete shock and awe.  
     We were always the closest of sisters,  but in this moment, gone forever are the days of our childhood.  Gone forever,  this person who was my sister, my role model growing up.  My flesh and blood who was lucky enough to be born this magnificent queen, only to die a slave. A slave to something I couldn‚Äôt even see or touch. To battle against something that isn‚Äôt even tangible is such a mind fuck!  
This moment of reckoning and confession was the hourglass turned over.  Im left to slowly watch the grains of sand that were the days, hours,  minutes, seconds of this life that was hers, cascade to the other side. Time is running out. Time is such a thief.  

The moment I always knew was going to happen after this coming out, eventually came to fruition. I dreamt of her death nightly. I thought of it daily. I knew she was at the point of no return. So I did what a sister who loves her sister does. I wrote her eulogy... and spoke about her life and the way her death affected me and my family. I can only pray I got the point across about the deep love I had for her as my sister, my best friend. 
 

To my sister, who I couldn‚Äôt have loved more...

I wake up today knowing I have to say goodbye to you. And I can't. These last few days haven't been real. I haven't really witnessed these things that are going to change me; haunt me, for years to come. As i try and remake your as I remember, I run my finger across your cheek, ever so lightly. She isn't real anymore. I trace your beautiful, perfect lips, remembering the smiles and the laughs. The moments. Those damn eyelashes of hers. I try and do the separating thing with the straight -pin trick. I poke your eye!  Your lifeless eye. I scream, forgetting what was, this task at hand. I finish, and every fiber of my being is shaking to my core. 
The mortician inspects and approves; phase two begins. 
He asks my mother a question that no mother who has just lost a child should be asked. ""would you like to grab her legs and help me place her in the casket?"" 

She hesitates for the briefest of seconds, before reaching down to grab her daughters legs that are encased in a plastic body bag. 
Ever so gently, she places her down to sleep for the last time. I see the river of pain running from her eyes at the knowledge of what she had just done. 

From the cradle to the grave.

I watched my dad weep like a new widow. The pain in those tears was so heartbreaking, for they told me what his words could not. Unable to be the hero he always had been. 
Just so unable this time. 
 
I look at these two little boys, whom I‚Äôve loved as my own...their world is essentially no more. Never again would they know her that way. Never again would they have the ONE thing that every child in the world wants and needs most. Their momma. A wiped tear from another would never do what their mothers touch did. That magical touch which heals all that is broken. The one God blessed every mother with that made her perfect in the eyes of her children.

She wasn't just this junkie as the stigma labeled her. No, she was so much more. A daughter, sister, mother, friend. A model, a dancer, my personal comedian...she was someone!!! And I am going to put her back onto her pedestal where she belongs.

To put you in a nutshell my beautiful sister, you are what I yearned to be. You were so beautiful and classy. Funny and ambitious. You could do anything, say anything. My admiration runs rather deep. I was so proud to be your sister! I loved your company and your humor. I loved your other side. The mischievous one. You were never afraid of anyone or anything. You always managed to make my day a little brighter, by being my silver lining.. 

Your love meant more to me than anything. Every moment of my life that included you, was so good. You radiated something that drew us near. I hope you know the impact you had. I hope you know you were an influence and my closest confidant. A sister that I held in the highest regard.

It brings me to my knees knowing I won't see you in the physical sense. Knowing I have to learn to live this life without you in it. 

Please send me little signs of you. 

Make me think of you,  so I can laugh silently to myself. 

Let me never forget your face and the beauty that was you. 

Play me a song in my head and let me remember the moment it was meant for. 

Let me recognize you in your children from your traits and features that you passed on to them.

I hope you truly are at rest now. Free to be the person you always were.

I know that every day must close, every dream must end and every bright light must burn out. 

Thank you beautiful sister for starting that fire with me, and watching it burn with me. Our embers will never die out. 

I'm sharing with God one of my most treasured gifts, 
and it would be my honor. 
For her honor.

2021-01-15 23:07:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/kybl7c/drug_addiction_everywhere_i_turn/,Drug Addiction Everywhere I Turn,"I grew up in the age of the Drug Awareness Resistance Education (D.A.R.E) and of the ""You smoke. You lose."" commercials. I was so convinced I would never touch a cigarette. Let alone drugs. Marijuana, Alcohol, Percocet, Oxycontin, Suboxone, Cocaine, Crack, Fentanyl. I have not done everything but I did my fair share. 

I got clean 2 and a half years ago. Since then, I have had mini relapses with fentanyl and cocaine after a year and a half completely sober. Now I am prescribed Suboxone. When I got clean I still had a father. I had more friends. Made and lost friends within that clean time. All lost to fentanyl.

Now I sit here in a hotel room. Technically I have been homeless for a little over a month. Living out of a hotel with my girlfriend, an active user. I met her almost 2 years ago and we fell for each other instantly. She was already using for a couple years at that time. Fentanyl and crack-cocaine. Since then, I have had more heartbreak than I could have imagined in a thousand lifetimes.

I tried to find a room to rent monthly for us. I could not find one. I make decent money, but the rents in Boston are out of control. And finding a room to rent as a couple that is affordable? Has been impossible. Something always got in our way. Price, background checks, credit checks, proof of income. They wanted all of this for both of us. None of which would end up looking good for her.  95% of places won't take couples no matter what. And honestly? With her habits, we shouldn't be fit for a place. Who wants to share an apartment with an active user? Even as her boyfriend, living with her terrifies me. Paying for a room for us feels like I would be enabling. She would know that she can keep using and I am still going to provide everything I can for her. 

The thought of her going back on the streets terrifies me. But the thought of us living like that? That is not happiness for me. That is pain, and continuing to do what I have been doing...waiting. Waiting for us to be sober together. Both working. Both saving. Eventually traveling, thoughts of marriage and family. I want it all with her. I love hard. And I know, undoubtedly, that she is my one.

Now I can no longer afford a hotel. So, after a huge fight where she broke up with me, I looked at rooms for just 1 person. Given my proof of income and sobriety, it was easy. I had 4 choices in 2 days of looking. I agreed to take one. Still staying at the hotel together despite our breakup, I told her we need to talk. And so I told her about the room. Followed by telling her my love for her. How I want nothing but her. How I have been immature and spineless in the ways I would berate her for her use and actions. How unhappy I am and I have no business being in this world of drugs and violence. Honestly I never did. 

A nice, quiet suburban white boy who got into his parents medicine cabinet and had no idea 5mg of oxycodone would lead to fentanyl and cocaine. I'm not triggered like most. I used to cope with depression, not for fun. And being sober again, released from the devil's grasp of addiction, my depression never really got out of control.

Now I sit here in the bathroom, hiding the tears streaming down my cheeks. Moving in a new apartment tomorrow. While my girlfriend will have nowhere to go. During our talk she told me that she'd be good. After all, she was going on 2 years homeless when I met her and hasn't had a place outside of the air bnbs and hotel rooms I have gotten for us. She has a toughness I could never possess. I don't think I could ever be homeless like that.

Despite her toughness, I am scared as hell and I am hurting so badly. I told her I would hold her things at the apartment and she could come over 1-2 days a week. Even that scares me. I can't risk getting myself kicked out by any means. I need this to have a place to rest for work and to do my online classes. I can't bare the thought of her on the street again. Especially the streets of Boston during the winter. But it is her choice to keep using. 

She is still not ready. And my thoughts now are of talking to a local police officer and asking them to section her. I tried, and failed, because I am not family. I tell them her family has abandoned her so I am all she has, and she is in danger being out there. They end up asking me if she is on probation, which I reply by saying no but she has warrants. So they told me to call the police and talk to them about detaining her. Do I do it? She was sectioned once for 30 days and planned on only smoking crack but no more dope. I told her that was a bad idea, but she loves it. She loves crack and cocaine so much, she used right away. A month later she was speedballing with dope. Now the habit is the same as before.

I want to do it so that I can sleep at night. Who can sleep in a warm bed, knowing the love of their life is most likely in a projects hallway or walking around aimlessly and beyond exhausted? She needs long term treatment. The 60 or 90 day sentence to detox, not the 30. But what if the police arrest her and she gets sentenced to jail time instead? That won't help her at all. She needs treatment, not punishment. My mind is flooded with these thoughts right now. And I have no idea what to do. With so little time to decide.

Anyways, I felt the urge to write this. Rather than continue pacing around filled with anxiety and worry. Drugs have been a constant in my life. Ruining my family, my friendships, stealing my early 20s from me, and putting a daily feeling of dread in my love life. I hate drugs, and I love this girl, both equally, with all of my heart. I will not abandon the one I love, so I continue to pray to any God if there even is one, to show my baby the path to sobriety. To the happy life as best friends and lovers that I want for us.

2021-01-15 06:29:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/kxsrbs/id_like_to_talk_about_treatment_harm_reduction/,"I‚Äôd like to talk about treatment, harm reduction, early intervention and more. I want to hear you, and I ultimately want to be able to help. What more should I be aware of when advocating for this community?","I am 100% for decriminalizing all illicit substances. (Don‚Äôt even get me started on alcohol being legal, romanticized and available on every corner, while deadlier than many other drugs, when someone using an illicit substance down the block is arrested and charged with a victimless, non-violent crime.) Ridding of the ridiculous stigma (applied to mental illness, as well) is a hot topic that needs much more attention. Harm reduction would also go a *long* way in the USA, and this could be in the form of providing safe/clean supplies, Narcan, housing, mental health services and more. 

I believe that we need more options for early intervention, as well. I read an article recently about an emergency department that got two physicians certified to prescribe a week of Suboxone to opioid addicts presenting to the ED in withdrawl, followed setting them up for a follow up within 72 hours and getting them on track with therapy and other tools in recovery. This is something hospitals nation wide should get on board with! In most cases, an addict showing up to the ED *desperate* for help is either ignored entirely, given fluids and some sort of sedative (most commonly a benzo), or sometimes given an opiate for their legitimate pain, but in all cases very rarely is any follow up plan provided, and the ones that are are sub-par and rarely acted on. I saw it every single day when working in the ED as a tech, mental health tech and eventually a medic. We need to give healthcare providers the tools to help these people. Most have no idea how to handle or treat addiction, substance abuse and misuse or mental illness in the acute setting; many can‚Äôt even make a dent in a dedicated inpatient setting. Other countries that decriminalize/legalize and offer safe havens, clean supplies, early intervention, job placement, counseling, rehabilitation and reintegration services are doing *so* well. The proof is there; we as a country just seem more interested in money. We seem to ignore the fact that the money would still be there, in much different form. 

That being said, the need for several new rehabilitation centers in every state is also there. The sheer number of addicts that decide they‚Äôre ready for help, spend a day calling around to find somewhere to go and get told there either isn‚Äôt a bed for them or their insurance won‚Äôt cover treatment is astounding. This window of self awareness and the desire to stop using and get better is important, and while many addicts *want* to stop shortly after the high turns into maintenance, the ability to get it often just isn‚Äôt a reality for most. It‚Äôs true that one absolutely needs to want help in order for that help to work, but the fact that most looking for it can‚Äôt get it is disturbing and overwhelming. I heard these stories during intake over and over and over again from almost every single person that *finally* made it in to a private facility I worked in, years ago. Likewise, I was working in a state facility before the pandemic. We took in a group of convicted felons with substance abuse issues once a month, a few hundred each time. Their 90 days with us replaced sentenced prison time; we offered a GED program, other education, job placement and reintegration assistance as well as thorough counseling during and after their stay. The waiting list for those beds was years long, and we *only* accepted *male* addicts with a criminal record. The sister facility up state for women was similarly overrun with need and no ability to provide. Rehab centers offering treatment to anyone with the ability to pay, regardless of other dynamics in their lives, are in even worse shape with room and funding. 

Now that I‚Äôm working from home in an entirely new field, separated from medical/MH/substance abuse, I spend my free time helping as many people as I can privately. I research, make calls to clinics and insurance providers, find transportation and more. The effort it takes to find a bed in a facility, only to be told it‚Äôll be given to someone else if you don‚Äôt show up in an hour or three (I realize this is often an incentive to make the person actually go, but it‚Äôs harmful as hell), as well as being told that you‚Äôll be cut off by your insurance after less than two weeks and kicked out unless you can pay (a popular thing told to addicts at this point is to *ask family* to lend them *thousands of dollars a day*) is insanity. That paired with the fact that many places have a one strike rule, and a large portion of people entering treatment are back to the same people, places and things and using in less than 14 days, 29 if they‚Äôre lucky is problematic at *least,* and lethal at most. Relapse is a normal and expected part of recovery, but many insurance providers have a three-stay lifetime cutoff for substance abuse facility stays. (I found this out in a very personal way when going for my second stay for alcohol abuse). 

There is so much *more* broken in the substance abuse world than ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people would like to say the addicts themselves are. 

Our criminal justice and prison systems as well as our substance abuse programs nationwide need an overhaul from the top down. Nobody deserves to be thrown in jail for having an illness. Nobody deserves to be turned away because someone else beat them to the punch (asking for help.) Nobody deserves a permanent record that hinder their ability *to get better* because they ‚Äúfailed‚Äù to stay on top of a disease they‚Äôre offered little to no help for.

Recently I met up with a cousin I hadn't seen for a while and he informed me of our family's history of addiction. All our aunties and uncles had drinking problems, including both our parents, I found out one uncle was addicted to heroin before he died about 20 years ago. Depression and anxiety is rampant through out the whole family, gambling addiction was prominent in a few of our aunties uncles. A few cousins including his brother have had alcohol problems. Then we both told each other that we both had attempted suicide one time over the past ten years. 

This has made me look at my own addiction differently. I've obviously have had massive guilt for my problems, now I'm not saying that I'm not going to hold myself accountable to my own actions because I do, but it does explain alot about my internal struggle. 

I've always hated what I'm doing but then I still do it then have the guilt and shame afterwards.

2021-01-14 14:47:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/kxd5kz/addiction_as_an_emotional_disorder/,Addiction as an emotional disorder,"Humans are mammals, and the very first primary-process emotion that all mammals share is the emotion of SEEKING (Panksepp, 2012). Although the idea that animals feel emotions is something that neuroscience has carefully avoided since the days of B.F. Skinner and behaviorism, Ivan Pavlov himself never discarded the idea that his dogs felt emotion, and even seemed convinced that his dogs contracted a form of PTSD when his lab was flooded. Behaviorism, which carefully avoided talking about the emotional state of animal subjects in any way, was succeeded by the cognitive revolution, which came about during the most recent technological revolution and appropriately likened the human brain to a kind of cognitive computer, with various brain structures functioning as ‚Äòinputs‚Äô and ‚Äòoutputs‚Äô. Many premier and influential neuroscientists still, to this day, believe that emotions are a uniquely human phenomenon; that emotions are somehow ‚Äòread-out‚Äô by higher cognitive centers in the brain and animals therefore do not feel true emotions (LeDoux, 2016).

We now know that the hard science simply doesn‚Äôt support this idea. As a result, some other powerful and influential neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio have even gone so far as to completely reverse their thinking and admit that the old ‚Äòread-out‚Äô theory of emotions was wrong and that emotions are generated by more evolutionarily ancient brain circuits (Damasio, 2010). What hard science has shown us ‚Äì and what Jaak Panksepp had been saying for decades before his death ‚Äì is that emotions are a fundamental property of animal life and an extremely basic, absolutely integral ingredient in any and all consciousness, including the ‚Äòcognitive‚Äô consciousness that underlies every single human thought.

Jaak Panksepp and his ‚Äòaffective neuroscience‚Äô perspective takes the position opposite the behaviorists and the cognitivists that followed them; Panksepp has been stating that emotions are a fundamental property of all animal life for decades, even as his work was marginalized and largely ignored by the mainstream neuroscientific community, which continues to be awash in outdated behavioral and cognitive models of thinking. Despite Panksepp‚Äôs incredible marginalization and the fact that basically nobody ever talks about his work, many of his ideas are proving to be incredibly prophetic and far-sighted while also being anchored in the hard neuroscience that Freud and others craved but simply didn‚Äôt have the technology to access. Hard neuroscience has been largely missing from psychology and psychiatry, where psychoanalysis has largely and half-assedly been replaced by pharmacotherapy, to the detriment of the happiness and health of us all - except the pill dealers. 

Panksepp‚Äôs invaluable contributions to the field, which are based in the hard neuroscientific work he did studying affective/emotional systems across mammalian species, have the potential to alleviate human suffering on an inconceivable scale, especially given the astounding rates of addiction, anxiety, depression, obesity, and other ‚Äòmental disorders‚Äô that we live with today, which might be better understood as emotional disorders given both the opaqueness of the term ‚Äòmental disorder‚Äô and the ever-mounting evidence that emotional processing is absolutely critical in our understanding and treatment of these disorders. 

Panksepp, prescient in his identification of the neural circuits underlying social connection and grief among mammals, predicted that understanding and treating brain inflammation would be critical in our future understanding of depression. His prediction has been validated by the recent breakthroughs in psychoneuroimmunology that prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that inflammation in the brain is implicated in all kinds of mental and other disorders, including depression (Nakazawa, 2020). Panksepp also showed astounding foresight in his relatively early discussions of the importance of understanding epigenetic processes ‚Äì but we cannot afford to wait another decade for Panksepp to be proven right yet again. It is time to bring the absolute treasure trove of affective neuroscience to the forefront of the treatment of emotional and mental disorders.

Panksepp describes emotions as ancient survival-valuation systems that have both an affective, emotional, ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô dimension and also engender specific actions, like seeking an escape when the FEAR circuit is stimulated. Panksepp did decades of homologous/cross-species mammalian research and testing of the various emotional circuits that he discovered existed deep in the ancient, evolutionarily pre-human, sub-cortical, subconscious structures that exist in all mammalian brains. He used probes to electrically stimulate these various emotional circuits and observed the effects of the stimulation on various levels and among different structures in the various circuits, among his other extensive testing and research.

At times I also suffered with depression and loneliness and did not have any value in myself. The times where I was contemplating suicide I was too chicken to and many times I hated myself. Every time my life would seem crappy I would smoke weed and be high most if not all of the day and this would also include being on the job as well. As soon as I would sober up I would want to get high as soon as possible. I smoked weed on and off for about four years.

I hid this addiction from the people I lived with and even when high I felt miserable and I started forgetting things and that would include having conversations with people and even leaving the water running in the bathroom while I was in the shower and forgetting that I even turned the sink on to begin with. I stopped weed on my own for a while but I always wanted to go back to smoking once I had a bad day and also the withdrawals were bad as well. I was also a gamer for over 20 years and would turn to video games when I was angry or even lonely. 

I would play video games when high as well and forget certain things in the game or just be so high I would fall asleep while playing. I would also masturbate multiple times in a week even when I had a partner and after a while I wanted to look at men as disposable toys. I thought that If I continue on with these addictions that I can take control of them instead of controlling me. I was planning a life for myself that would of ended up getting me in a deeper mess than I was already in as well as taking others for the ride and messing their lives up as well. 

One day online I randomly stumbled across a testimony of a girl who was living a similar lifestyle to mine and she was heading down the same road as I was. I grew up in church and I always hated going and the christians I saw were only acting like christians on Sunday only. The testimony I saw showed me that this girl was genuine and I realized that Jesus was the only solution that I did not try. 

I tried meditation and yoga and at times I would be more stressed over those things and looking at those options today there are studies that are hidden about the risk and dangers of meditation and yoga. I tried being a vegetarian for a year and a vegan for three months in hopes of looking better and then using men as toys to get back at the ones who hurt me in the past but the diet route only made me get sick. 

When I decided to give Jesus a chance my life became better. Reading the Bible has shown me my true worth and a few months after Jesus came into my life I had the strength to sell all of my gaming consoles. My family started to see a change in me and even saw that I changed the way I dressed. I now dislike the smell of weed and when it comes to me being stressed and depressed prayer helps me get rid of those emotions faster than weed ever did in my life. 

It took me longer to break masturbation but Jesus was the only one who could help me break the urge to masturbate and even want to look for a man just to have sex with but now I am looking to be happy with someone and really love them for who they are instead. I am not writing this story to push Christianity on you but I am a witness to tell you Jesus does save and change lives as he did mines.

Long story short this a throwaway and I quit adderall 2 days ago. I‚Äôve been on and off for 2 years and continuously trying to stop. I‚Äôm currently in college but feel like I‚Äôm wasting it away being stuck in bed and stuck in my head 24/7. I have small spurts where I realize how much of my life I‚Äôm wasting away and how anti social I have become. Women don‚Äôt excite me, I didn‚Äôt want to go out on my 21st because I saw no point, life seems very pointless and that there is point in doing anything human besides being a robot all day. Heavy anhedonia, and nothing excites me or makes me laugh. I have a 600cc motorcycle I just topped out to try and feel some rush or anything and it gives me the same joy as staring at my phone all day. This usually is the period between when I usually take it from 11-7pm at its worse but persists until late at night. I‚Äôve tried caffeine and L tyrosine as well as lifting. I have next to no energy to lift, c4 pre workout hardly makes a difference and if anything makes me extremely fatigued, even at smaller doses. I do not believe I was ever adhd but it was so easy to be prescribed it. I only take 20mg xr or more depending on the day.  I am completely dependent on it. When I take a high dose I feel like I return to my pre adderall self, I can laugh and joke, I have no social anxiety (which I have never had before, or any anxiety for that reason). Another big factor is my self confidence and ego have completely diminished. Feeling in the moment is very hard, going to the beach vs going to the library gives me the same bland boring feeling and I‚Äôd rather lay in bed and do nothing, I have lost all of my hobbies. I‚Äôm struggling to feel anything, many co workers and friends notice how down and depressed I am 24/7 which only makes it worse and feeling like I‚Äôm a shell of my old self.

Loving mother and father, happily married, three younger siblings - caring, supportive, amazing individuals. Super strong, intelligent, fun core friend group, and layers and layers of supportive people beyond them. Even thinking about it now is almost overwhelming knowing so many people care. 
Born genetically stellar, 6‚Äô0, athlete, model, smart, empath, green eyes, and loyal to a fault. Couldn‚Äôt complain if I wanted too. 
The best part, a relationship with God incomprehensible or comparable to anything perceivable. Forgiving - in times of doubt He reminded me He was there. Several experiences I will never forget. 

... Now, a full blown adderall addict. 

520 mg‚Äôs within 60 hours addict: 
Not sleeping for 113 hours addict: 
Rushed to an emergency room addict: 
Lying to the ones who love me most addict: 
Scared when the plug re-ups addict: 
Stealing from best friends addict: 
Not wanting to stop addict: 

Unknown addict... 

Currently at its peek, the addiction has been forming for two years. My family knows but not the reality of how deep it‚Äôs rooted, partly sold as depression, mostly lying out of shame. The close friends I have told are supportive but can‚Äôt see it, or don‚Äôt believe it. Even when telling them how deep I am, truthfully, I‚Äôm not sure they understand. Not sure I understood for a year and a half. 
Never thought I‚Äôd be a drug addict - didn‚Äôt use any drugs in general (really) until I was 21. Then one day you realize the thing you‚Äôre the most afraid of is not being able to stop consuming a substance. Running out of reasons, excuses for why you should even be taking them. Rejecting help with the notion of inner-strength to do it on my own, knowing I‚Äôd jump at any available. Having my hero, my father, cry over my shoulder in desperation for simply wanting to help in any way possible; then telling him to leave me alone...

I love my Dad, so, so much.

So why am I letting this chemical take over my life? Couldn‚Äôt give you a reason that I actually believed.

I need help - all the help.

Where do I start?
How should I start?
Where can I go?
Should I go somewhere?

This morning I was getting kicked out of my motel room as per usual and some dude who I‚Äôve seen around but always kinda just brushed off said hi and told me he had some fent. Of course my brain immediately disregarded everything about the situation except for the word ‚Äúfenr@.

I followed him up to this room off a hallway where the ice machine was, he asked me if I wanted to hit his bowl, I don‚Äôt smoke ice a lot but I‚Äôll take a hit or two socially, he kept urging me to hit it over and over. I eventually made him take it back and asked if he had the down. He said it was in his room, but he needed something from me. I‚Äôve been in this position before but I draw the line here. I have pretty bad ptsd from being sexually abused from ages 6-12 and I‚Äôm very non sexual. I said no I‚Äôm not like that, I‚Äôll just go.

He pushed me up against the wall, shoved his hand down my pants and pulled them down and put his mouth down there. I hate myself so much I just froze. I always thought if anyone tried to do this to me again I‚Äôd be a bad ass and punch them or kick em in the nuts but I just froze. I started shaking and crying and he flipped out telling me to shut up and asking what my problem was. He apologized and said let‚Äôs go get the fent. 

Now you‚Äôd think the last thing my dumb ass would do is follow this man to his room but I did. I was just kinda floating through my own existence, thinking about how now I REALLY needed to get high. He didn‚Äôt have a key and his homeboy wouldn‚Äôt open the door. I‚Äôm probably very luck that we couldn‚Äôt get in, who knows what would‚Äôve happened. 

All of this and all I could think about at first was how I was pissed I didn‚Äôt get any down out of it. I‚Äôve been so disassociated all day, I haven‚Äôt felt it but I‚Äôm starting to come back to myself and I can‚Äôt stop shaking and crying. I feel lightheaded from hyperventilating. I‚Äôm having flashbacks to my childhood and this morning everytime I close my eyes. I feel disgusting. I‚Äôve taken 4 showers and I still can‚Äôt scrub the filth off of me. I hate myself so much. How could I let this happen to me over a fucking drug? A drug that‚Äôs already taken everything it possibly could from me? Why? Why do I love this stupid fucking powder so much? Why do I have to need it so bad? Why am I so fucking stupid?

Idk what to do. I feel like a ghost of myself and I can‚Äôt even get high or get out of the cold. I‚Äôm just sitting outside of a motel freezing my ass off and crying. My friend was letting me chill in his room but his girl came back about an hour ago and flipped so now I‚Äôm just out here. I‚Äôm so alone. I‚Äôm so fucking tired. I feel so broken. I hate feeling fucking sorry for myself. I hate being pitied but I feel so fucking pitiful right now. So pathetic and worthless and stupid. I let this man do this to me because I was chasing a drug.

On this occasion I ended up using for around 10 days and then stopped abruptly. I experienced my first taste of withdrawals; a few days of anxiety and vivid nightmares. Although it wasn‚Äôt exactly pleasant, it was completely manageable. I realised that if I continued to abuse the substance I could end up in a difficult position, but that thought was clouded by that of how much I enjoyed those days on the diazepam. I was more social, felt better about myself and felt happy in myself. The next 10 months I constantly struggled with addiction. I would purchase upwards of 100 pills with the ideation that I could just use every once in a while. Although I did believe this, I was fooling myself. I would find myself coming out of a blackout days later only to realise I‚Äôd taken the vast majority of the pills. I would have missed work, damaged my home and terrified my parents. I would come out the other side of this, get myself clean and get back into a good place. And then relapse and do the same thing. I would consume such ridiculous amounts of pills in one go I don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt overdose. Once I took one or two I would completely lose control. Withdrawals got worse and worse to the point where i would still feel awful weeks after. Finally my parents sent me to Rehab where I was able to get closer to working out why addiction had such a hold on me. I came out 2 weeks ago and I can feel myself slipping. I know I‚Äôm going to end up relapsing and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve told people, talked to people, but it‚Äôs not helping. Does anyone have any advice?

It was the 28 December. I was drinking with a friend and co-worker. He just asked me why I always drink. I drink every free day before this day and had always a hard craving for booze. I sat down with him and we talked for hours about my life and my problems. Often he said that I should stop drinking. I saw it as fun and giggles. After he went home I talked to a friend of mine. She also told me that I should quit. It seemed like a broken record repeating itself again and again. All this happened before. I quit and have a craving. I smoke more. That was the result of the last times trying to quit. But this night I realized it had to stop. All I had destroyed by being drunk. All destroyed because of my addiction. 

I sat down this night and thought what I wanted in life. Where I want to be. And most importantly what is holding me back. Since this night I didn't drunk. I still have a beer bottle right on my desk. Right next to me. Just as my father (sober since about 30 years) has a bottle of brandy inside the cabinet in the living room. 

The hard part isn't staying away from it. It's the not drinking. Not thinking about it. 

Either I'm talking with people or I'm sleeping all day long to not even get the smallest thought about drinking. But all activity doesn't matter if you don't have a person you talk to when having the desire to drink again. For me it is my coworker. Who is it for you? Find someone. Someone who doesn't say don't drink. But someone who supports you and tries to get the problem, the trigger away.

Good morning Reddit. I am a 30 year old working as a Recovery Coach in MA. I have been working in this job for 2 years and have a nice office and a desk and meet clients much like the OP department under the same company. This has lead me to think about my future. I would really like to try and become a LADC 1 and use my work experience for hours and complete school as well. I have worked in the field on the Peer side for 4 years and Clinically in DYS detention centers for 2. I myself am in recovery from opiates and used MAT to help obtain my sustained recovery. I am in close communication with the Clinic that I engaged with and talk to those clients coming in for the first time or those struggling to understand how to try and make MAT work for them on a regular basis. I am wondering if any of this (obviously including the actual work hours supervised by the director of Peer Services and my hours as Recovery Coach Supervisor) would count towards the hours for LADC if they happened before I started attending College in order to get the degrees necessary for the license.

&#x200B;

I have also seen some breakdowns of how each level works and what you need but nothing really seems to be exactly the same. 

I have been told I can be a LADC Assistant without college and just work hours. I was told I could do 6000 work hours and become a LADC 2 and only need an associates going for a bachelors and the required hours (which is, I believe 4000-6000hrs more  ON TOP of the amount a bachelors or masters degree would have to do) which is somewhere around 8000-10k and I can be a LADC 1 in the state of Massachusetts with basically general studies and work hours. 

If there is anyone who took the ""Extra Work Hours"" route for LADC Licensure instead of just college and minimal work hours so that I may see which one fits my situation best for me to try I would truly appreciate it. 

I believe being a peer worker for so long and working with multiple pathways and meeting Recoverees where they are at and having gone through it myself and having helped those same individuals extensively AFTER they obtain sustained Recovery and need assistance with what to do with life AFTER being in control of themselves from the grip of substances, will give me a uniquely helpful and slightly new approach to Clinical things such as LADC or other substance use disorder Clinical Services.

&#x200B;

I told myself I would do anything to change the way people are treated when they go through the struggle of addiction and I have slowly but progressively made myself travel further up the chains of the field to attempt to build a voice. Obtaining clinical licensure would give me an aspect of both sides in a unique way and could even help me with my ultimate goal of creating a new profession that combines the best of all aspects of the RIGHT TREATMENT/ENGAGEMENT/SERVICES.

&#x200B;

A Mix of Clinical techniques with the understanding and direction of peer models, with no forced action and harm reduction based practices that do not have harm to begin with or to start the process in turn making them a ""**By Choice Abstinence Based but there's no way to be kicked out for your addiction doing what addictions do**"" based program (professional and more scientific name coming as soon as someone takes me seriously enough to start something like this up. Tired of seeing people in Detox kicked out for sneaking drugs in or using on the unit, because THATS WHAT THEIR ADDICTION DOES TO THEM. They don't care about consequences or danger or anything, just the use. I know there's all varying degrees because everyone is unique and their situation is unique but that doesn't change that addiction CHANGES someone. You cannot shun someone and cause negative things to happen to them WHILE they are already feeling negative about not having control over doing something to themselves to the point they leave everything behind and go live inpatient for help, and expect a POSITIVE RESULT when you throw them on the street.

Gosnold in Falmouth, MA had one of the best physical setups to fix this issue of ""We are going to remove you from treatment for your illness because your illness symptoms don't follow our rules for treatment of that illness""

An area where someone must be medically cleared to enter the general population area. Whether they first come in and are high as a kite, or they are withdrawing and feeling unwell or even looking unwell as BOTH of these could trigger the other Recoverees in the program especially in the fragile stages of early recovery like 24 hrs. - 1 month. The area had 2 sides with 14 beds (or more my memory is fuzzy on that part) and once a person is cleared they would go to the living quarters with a courtyard in the MIDDLE providing no secret exits outside the facility AND there were no rules on common conversation between age, race, gender identity, or sexual preference. I say this because most programs separate men and women and THAT RULE ALONE IS WHAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO BREAK IT. At Falmouth there were never major issues regarding fraternization because there weren't strict rules saying ""YOU CAN **NOT** SAY HELLO OR CONVERSATE WITH ANYONE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX AND YOU CANT SIT NEXT TO THEM OR PLAY CARDS OR ........"" Like every other program has in place for their ""Liabilities"".

I digress from my rant of why I want to get the LADC and my passion for attempting to make a huge stigma and stereotype change not only to the average individual and their feelings on Substance Use Disorder and Treatment and Recovery but even those INSIDE the field, who are even WORKING in a way they think is helping when it is actually causing more harm than good in some cases. Ill end any discussion on that with this. You could tell me a million stories where EACH WAY WORKED FOR SOMEONE, that will never be wrong because there is no RIGHT or WRONG way to recover from substance use as long as it WORKS for the person WORKING IT. It comes down to the fact that the pathway we take INTO USE is a mostly confusing winding looping long but frail and  erratic spontaneous and arduous BUT ENTIRELY UNQIUE TO US AND OUR SITUATION, 

THERFORE

OUR PATHWAY OUT MUST BE JUST AS UNIQUE

&#x200B;

People in Recovery are Like Snowflakes, EVERY SINGLE ONE HAS A DIFFERENT STORY AND A DIFFERENT PATHWAY IN AND OUT. Some situations and individuals may seem SIMILAR but they are NEVER EXACTLY the SAME. Someone could do something 99% the same way as someone else or seem to have a 99% same situation leading to Use or leading to sustained Recovery but I can guarantee that there is ALWAYS a UNIQUE difference SOMEWHERE in the STORY. We need to embrace these differences and put VALUE on them and if 1 million types of treatment and services and engagements are needed to treat 1 million people, then it is OUR responsibilities to help EACH and EVERY UNIQUE INDIVIDUAL WITH THEIR UNIQUE STORY, to FIND THAT UNIQUE PATH THAT WORKS FOR THEM!

i would do anything to stop my mind, to stop the overthinking and the restlessness. i want to be someone that i could not be. my first overdosed, i was playing donny hathaway ""a song for you"", it was a song i dedicated to myself and the one i loved, my friends and my family. but when it hits, when i knew i took it too much and i knew what i was doing, regret rushed in and i wondered if i stayed there would be the times life wouldn't be so painful to bear. and i prayed even though i never trusted in god before, prayed that im not going to die that night. my mum came back and she called an ambulance, they were asking questions but my tongue couldn't function like it used to so i shouted stop asking, it's the only strength in me to use those words because physically i was drowsy and was not entirely conscious anymore.

the second overdosed, it was never my intention. yet it happened, i thought it was something else. my eyes wouldn't work, i couldn't see properly and it would only be able to look up, the blinking got severe and sometimes hurts. my history of overdosed, i was hospitalized again. this time, i was alone. my ex was there, my mum had to go back and i couldn't sleep for the entire night. they won't even give me anything. i cried again, i wished that it wouldn't have come to this. tbh, i always like being around hospital, i mean being on the bed as patient, because now someone is taking care of me. not something i am familiar with. between life and death, why do they start caring now? but i know that's just my thought, not a reality of someone's viewpoint of me.

i was clean for almost a year and after an event that happened recently, i started taking it. and it was a safe amount yet i know it's bullshit. that one day it might happen again. i want to talk about it to my psychiatrist, but she might stop giving me treatment after we made a promise about my compliance. and i don't want to lose that, she has been helpful. it's just my own choice when it comes to bad experience or feelings or thoughts, uncomfortable situation and the heartbreak, the loneliness and no self esteem and not loving myself enough to stop myself from doing so. i am so completely self aware but it's like i would do it again, just to feel normal. normal for me is a clean slate of thoughts where i won't feel too much.

3rd day today I felt the side effects. Heavy palpitations. Headache. Slowed breathing and little bit of shaking.  And worse part is I still can't sleep because of this. Been awake for almost 24hrs now.

These two processes look very similar. In both cases, you have to be an active part of your recovery. In both cases you have to identify triggers, find healthy coping mechanisms, and fight against your almighty thinking brain. Where I get stuck is that addiction cannot be cured. Hell, it can‚Äôt even be treated it is only up to the addict. Mental health you can be medicated and that at least helps in a lot of cases of your willing to take your meds. But drugs? Shit. Powerless. No known cure. I feel like a lost cause. Despite my psych meds I still suck at self care. I am not a kale eating, daily walking, book reading yogi. Nor do I have any idea how to be.

I recently (37 days ago, and counting) stopped drinking and am hoping to not start again. Am I 'cheating' and/or making things harder for myself if I drink alcohol-free beer? 

For background, while I don't think I was ever 'officially' an alcoholic, as in having a physical dependance, I have been in the habit of drinking quite a lot, on and off, since being a teenager. I'm now 59. At the worst point in my drinking, I probably had 6 beers, a bottle of wine and most of a bottle of vodka per night. I stopped spirits many years ago (apart from very occasional ones), I pretty much stopped wine about 1 year ago (with occasional binges), and now I've stopped all alcohol. Until I stopped, I have been recently drinking 5 - 7 beer/cider per night, almost every night. I've had attempts at stopping before (dry July, that kind of thing) but this is, I think, the longest I've been dry, ever. 

I miss two things: #1 the 'escape' in an evening from life's problems, which I think I'm mostly past, because I appreciate waking up clear-headed, and #2 that first slug of a really cold beer! Weirdly, it's this second one that I'm missing the most. 

I can't have just '1' drink; it has always been easier for me to have an evening without drinking, than to have just a small amount. ""1 is too many, 6 is not enough"".

I am seriously almost done with the compassion with my brother, I think he is now not receiving (or ever received) enough consequences for his behaviour.

I‚Äôm borrowing credit card debt to pay for dads funeral, helping my mum with everything, visiting the doctor with heart palpitations because I‚Äôm so stressed - and he‚Äôs just burning mums money on coke and poker apps.

He‚Äôs barely remorseful.

I know addiction is an illness - but damn, he‚Äôs squarely.. SQUARELY putting himself (his own roof, his own need to eat, his own everything) before everyone else right now.

He even once (I found out) made my dad to pay off one of his dealers because they were hounding him. Imagine putting your own parent at that much risk?

People say he needs help. He is SURROUNDED by help (the mental health team, free counselling, step change, family support, a guy to manage his finances with him, government money, very supportive employer) - to my mind he needs consequences. Consequences not compassion. Because honestly, I don‚Äôt think he has any idea just how selfish he is.

My cousin‚Äôs (C - 30, F) ex bf (X) got her hooked on opioids to the point of him physically abusing her kids.. she ended up having her kids taken away (they live with the dad (D) now) and she became homeless

I only recently found out and have been trying to help her. At some point she ran to my apartment with no phone and I convinced her to finally stay with her mom and get help. She was going through withdrawals and very against her mom but she went angrily

She went to rehab.. got clean for about 3 weeks and then left. She gets VERY antsy and full of anxiety. Her mom has already been through this with my cousins dad and sister.. so she tries to prevent C from going to my area too much since that‚Äôs where she lived on the streets

But my cousin is going to do what she wants. She asked me to take her to a sober friends house and I did. I met this person and she‚Äôs great! The next day she asked me to take her there again but when we get there, sober friend isn‚Äôt home. So she hangs out at my place and runs away. Comes back before 10 but ends up relapsing in my apartment and almost dying. I was so tired I was barely awake to realize she was relapsing.

Police come. She‚Äôs saved. Takes a few days to care about dying. Then she starts taking rehab serious again... saying she loves meetings and the sober network....

A month later fast forward to a few days ago... she asked to come over again so  she can clean out the storage with her ex husband. 

The day she comes over, she came across a old hs friend and really wants to see her. I told her that would make me uncomfortable so I‚Äôd rather not since idk her and she almost died a month ago. She says I‚Äôm being controlling and after throwing a tantrum, ends up walking out anyway. She says it‚Äôs just for dessert. She ends up talking so much she forgets to call me. I‚Äôm waiting up for her on a night before work because she doesn‚Äôt have a key to get into my place. She says she‚Äôll be back in the morning since she talked so much she lost track of time. Annoyed, I say ok.

Her ex husband shows up at my apartment to go to the storage and she isn‚Äôt here. She doesn‚Äôt answer her phone since her friends house has bad internet service

Her ex husband and her mom get upset at her and don‚Äôt believe she is where she is because it‚Äôs been hours since she responds. When she finally answers me.. I tell her to call them because they are worried.. she says she will... 30 mins later and still hasn‚Äôt called anyone. In short... people think she‚Äôs missing again... and she gets upset that people are freaking out.


She refuses to stay with her mom because her mom got so mad she called her a hooker (C has been sleeping around lately but still should not have been called that)... C gets so upset at me too because I told her I didn‚Äôt like that she didn‚Äôt call anyone back that she doesn‚Äôt want to stay with me.

She stays with her friend 


I finally get in contact with her two days later (today)


She was high when I picked her up. Mumbling and complaining about her friend.. yet wanting to go back because she wants to be there for her friends kids...

I told her she shouldn‚Äôt be high around kids. She said she isn‚Äôt.

Her other friend ended up picking her up and taking her back to her


So idk what to do really

I at least kind of have the address and phone number of where she‚Äôll be at... but not really since her friend doesn‚Äôt really answer.

Hello all. 

I wanted to start a journal, publicly (while staying anonymous ;) ), about my battle with addiction and hopefully overcoming it.  

A little background on myself. My name is Phil, I am 30 years old, no kids, girlfriend, and I work in IT. My addiction started back in 2015 after I got out of the army. Before this, I was never addicted to ANYTHING. I barely ever drank, only took prescribed pills (Percocet once when I got my Wisdom teeth out) and never even thought about EVER buying drugs illegally.  I am honestly not sure what started it but I remember one night (early 2015) I had a tooth ache. My wife at the time got me a couple Vicodin's and I thought, why not? Boy.. was that fantastic.. and I had no clue at that time I was about to start a path of addiction. 

Before I knew it I was buying tramadol left and right from a someone who was prescribed to them and I started this constant rotation of being on the pills for a week or two until my source ran out, suffering through a week or three of the shittiest withdrawals ever, and ALWAYS giving in and buying more when my source replenished their supply and AFTER I had beaten the severe withdrawal symptoms. I have wasted so much money, time and just life on this worthless drug. 

Now.. with the discovery of Kratom (started heavy usage about 4 months ago) I have been able to cut down my tramadol use quite a bit. The only problem is is that Kratom seems to be just as bad. It has caused me to gain weight, lose productivity at work, and all around become someone who I could never imagine being. Its changed my outlook on life to something terrible and I really really need to make a change. 

I need to get clean.. for good. I need to stay off the pills and off the Kratom. I have told my self this a thousand times it seems like, but NOONE knows of my addiction so I am constantly battling this alone and I need help from you my friends. Please. I really need support and words of encouragement. Starting tomorrow I will update this post daily with how the withdrawals are going and just a general assessment of my day. I have been through this a million times... but I promise this will be the last. Tha main purpose of this is to keep myself accountable. 

&#x200B;

I will be eternally grateful for any and all support. Thank you all.

This is a HUGE accomplishment for me because, in all the times I have attempted sobriety before, I have usually made it to 20some days and then just thought the whole thing was stupid and stopped. I always let my cravings talk me into throwing sobriety and recovery out the window. Not this time!!!

My behaviors were not extreme (primarily PMO and written erotica and vanilla stuff at that), and the actual acting out episodes maybe took an hour a week or less. BUT the corresponding guilt and shame were so all-consuming that I often felt paralyzed for hours and days at a time. While I was able to drag myself through the basic motions of work and household responsibilities, inside I was drowning in misery and very, very far from living my best life.

However, through sobriety, I have regained the wonderful gifts of time and mental clarity! While yes, I do have some periodic physical tension and mental cravings for a release, they pale in comparison to what I have gained. Just in the past month, I have accomplished the following:

\-Finished an adult education course on linguistics I had been struggling with for months and started a new course on the history of Ireland that I am about 60% through already

\-Read 5 1/2 books (about 1650 pages), mostly intellectually challenging memoirs and literary fiction

\-Recommitted to a daily meditation practice that I have done faithfully

\-Kicked my workouts up a few notches, to the great praise of my personal trainer

\-Spent a lot more quality time with the family members who represent my current household (instead of just hiding in my room feeling depressed most of the time)

\-Started therapy to ensure I can make this round of sobriety and recovery stick

Please keep in mind this is all while working full-time at a very demanding senior management job as well as parenting my teenage children. 

The keys are really that, while I still have some twinges of guilt and shame about my past behavior (and as I work through my treatment program I am sure more will come to the surface from time to time), nearly all of my brain fog from the suffocating cloud of intense shame has been lifted.

In 2019, the Canadian Cannabis Survey found roughly 20% of Canadians admitted to using cannabis regularly. That means there‚Äôs a good chance quite a few people are combining these two substances and possibly putting themselves at risk. 


How Does Caffeine Affect The Brain?


Many people have started consuming caffeine during their teen years, if not earlier. Caffeine is a psychoactive compound that can impact your mood, emotions, and behavior. If you use too much of it or combine it with other substances, including THC from cannabis, you may experience heightened versions of those effects. Caffeine is a naturally occurring alkaloid found in coffee beans and tea leaves. It‚Äôs also added to many beverages, including sodas and foods such as chocolate. 


Caffeine is a stimulant that has a direct impact on your central nervous system once consumed. It works by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. When you block those receptors, people can experience excitability, nervousness, and hyperactivity. 


It also helps the brain feel more alert and awake. Caffeine also directly impacts the neurotransmitter dopamine, also known as the brain‚Äôs reward zone or pleasure center. Researchers believe that‚Äôs the same part of the brain that THC affects when you ingest it in some way. But, a double boost of dopamine isn‚Äôt always a good thing.


Excessive caffeine use can cause irritability, anxiety, and sleep problems over time. That‚Äôs why, even if we easily forget that caffeine is a drug, we should limit how much we consume.

When I smoke I will have around 3 cigarettes in a sitting and more if im drunk. I'll go through roughly a pack a week, or 5-6 days. I smoked a 20 pack in around 5 hours at my work christmas party while bent out of shape and decided to focus on running every day after work. I had started running and noticed my lungs giving in after teh first few days so I stopped smoking immediately for about 3 weeks and never looked back. However where I live had bad rain for about 2-3 weeks and I lost motivation due to not being able to run. So I started smoking casually again.

&#x200B;

The problem that Im facing is I never smoke because I physically feel the need to, its because I genuinely enjoy doing it. I love inhaling the smoke, standing there with a dart in my hand. Every part from rolling it to the inhale and exhale I just enjoy it. When I'm actively smoking I do get cravings when I see a smoke or just get the sudden urge however I don't feel like I need to have one at that moment. My SO and I go back and forth on whether or not I am addicted to smoking cigarettes. Again I've never felt any physical withdrawal or effects from not smoking, just the cravings. I don't deny that Im a smoker, I actually just don't care. I know that this is a phase and that I'll eventually grow out of it, my thought process is that if I spent 2 years of my adult life (26 btw) and stopped am I really going to suffer any long term health issues when I'm older?

&#x200B;

I've had other addictions in the past like weed and benzos where I've felt physical withdrawals and I was at the mercy of my own poor self control and impulsive behavior of which I was able to kick. I also believe and tell people that if I could get off of benzos then I could quit anything.

I have an addiction. 
      It isn‚Äôt something to laugh at and make jokes about or talk bad about. Addiction is more serious than non addicts will ever know. Addiction can lead to death. The other day someone (not saying names) told everyone and their brother that I‚Äôm on meth and man you should have seen the comments. Honestly I wish I would have screenshot them so I could post them on this post, but I didn‚Äôt. I was being called a meth head, dope fein, good for nothing addict, etc. Those words right there is enough for someone to kill themselves, but did the people who said that stuff stop to think about that? No. Why? Because they don‚Äôt care about anyone else‚Äôs feelings. My ex best friend even bashed me, KNOWING about my past addiction. (Yes this is the second time.. woohoo) People who have never been addicted or truly addicted to a drug will NEVER know the fight that we, who are in fact addicted, battle everyday. The ones trying to sober up (me) and stay sober fight an even bigger battle because all we want everyday is to feel that high that the drug gave us. Some people can‚Äôt even function without their ‚Äúmedicine.‚Äù I used to be apart of them people. Meth has taken over my life once before and it damn near took it over again. But I‚Äôll be DAMNED if I fall back down that hole!! My son needs his mama, and his mama I WILL FOREVER BE! I never gave up on him, I just couldn‚Äôt control my actions so I kept him away, somewhere safe, with his father! I did what I thought was best for my son, sorry you haters didn‚Äôt think that was best. But guess what, you‚Äôre not the mama, I AM!! So the next time you see someone or even if you know someone battling addiction, instead of calling them names and laughing at them; sit next to them, hold their hand or hug them tight and say ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs hard, but you got this and I‚Äôll be right here the whole way!‚Äù That‚Äôs all we want, is to know someone is there supporting us and to be proud of us that are trying.

Sometimes I can't believe I'm still alive. At one point I was on the highway to hell. I was actually convinced that I'd be six feet under before reaching age 18. But thankfully, I was wrong and I survived. But damn, has it been a wild and stressful ride. I don't wanna go into extensive details and give you my life story. But basically I started using drugs, drinking, and partying at a young age. By the time I was 16, I was so burned out that getting high wasn't even exciting anymore. But despite all this, I still continued to use, because getting high and escaping reality was the only path in life that I knew.

Around late 2018, I quit using drugs and have been clean ever since. Two years clean. I'm amazed. Never thought I could do it. But the thing is, I never once went to rehab or participated in any type of drug treatment. I just quit with my own willpower. I've never been the kind of person to seek help. I've had people tell me how strong I am for quitting, without even getting any help. And even though I am proud of myself, the truth is, I still have many unresolved issues. I still have a lot of trauma. Even though I'm clean...I don't feel clean. My mind still feels trapped. I don't feel like I ever reached any type of closure. I still feel haunted by the past. If that makes sense.

And I will admit, sometimes without drugs, I do feel a lack of identity. The sober me hasn't had that long to form, in comparison to how long I used. I had to walk away from certain friendships and people forever to get where I am now. Sometimes I just feel so empty inside and confused. Perhaps I should seek out some sort of help. Like I said, even though I'm clean, part of my soul still feels like an addict.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5888162}"

I'm 29 and I lost my job back in April 2020 due to Covid and have been unemployed since then. I wiped all my savings trying to survive without making any money for a good 6 months, and finally, I gave up and moved back to the family house two months ago. Thankfully I am not required to pay for any bills, rent or food. I'm entitled to the unemployment funding and I get $265 a month. I am also under $10k debt which I am unable to make any payments to, as I instantly spend the funds I get on records. I am basically financially unstable and will be for a very long time if I keep on buying records.

I've recently gotten a loan of $2000 from my bank and spent $1100 of it to buy records ($400 on a single record) and the rest on a new drone. I could've used it to make payments for my existing loans but didn't take that route, because I'm dumb as a pea. I have 4 credit cards and only have $17 available in total. Still thinking of buying records with it...

On a good day, I spent hours surfing records store's online shops and Discogs to see if a record in my wishlist is available. And if I see an item is on low stock or a rare copy of a release that I've been looking for a very long time is available on Discogs my inner urges force me to purchase it without even thinking of my financial situation.  I am so scared of not being the one that owns a rare record.

2021-01-09 22:05:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ku60ov/a_brief_history/,A brief history,"I‚Äôve hesitated to write this post on fentanyl for awhile now for a few reasons. For starters, I didn‚Äôt want to seem to be abjuring responsibility for the events that led to my prison sentence. What happened was tragic, and I admittedly played a role in what transpired, however well-intentioned and unthinking.

If I‚Äôm being honest, in a world where this post gained traction, I fear that the following criticism of certain powerful entities would be harm my employment prospects 5 years from now than my criminal history.

Firstly, some eye-opening stats (as best as I can recall): deaths due to opiod (esp. fentanyl) overdoses number 50,000+ every year, or the total number of U.S. casualties in the Vietnam War. The opiod epidemic has affected every strata of society; unlike previous drug epidemics (e.g. crack), one socioeconomic class or ethnicity hasnt suffered alone. No one has been immune.

During the Bush/Obama years, for the first time ever in this country, the life expectancy for an entire ethnic group *declined*; in an unenviable bit of white privilege, whites committed slow-motion suicide via drugs and drink for the first part of the 21st century. (The situation for the white working class was exceptionally dire). They were also committing suicide-suicide at higher rates than ever.

As anyone deep into the drug world during the 2010s can attest, opioid deaths, particularly due to fentanyl overdoses, were a ubiquitous feature of the scene. I knew of half a dozen or so victims (friends of friends, etc.) before I even started dabbling in opiates. When I progressed to dope, it was like every single user I knew had OD‚Äôed at least once from a fentanyl-laced pack. Even more shocking (in retrospect), no one batted an eye at this fatal fact, myself included; we jus kinda shrugged and accepted it as part of the bargain.

When I think of its unprecedented nature and staggering reach throughout society, the tragedy of fentanyl overdose deaths has become a (counter)cultural watermark for life in 2010s America, just like the acid trip and the expansion of consciousness was in the 60s.

The ongoing fentanyl epidemic in the U.S. is really a story in two parts.

The introduction of oxycontin domestically thru Purdue Pharma‚Äôs stunning duplicity is a commonly accepted origin point. But I think such a diagnosis is too facile. The American ruling class is truly the responsible party. They‚Äôve relentlessly shat on citizens by enacting policies catering to special interests and global corporations, squandered the advantages of being the lone superpower during the past 30 years far quicker than anyone imagined.

The second part of this story tells of a foreign adversary far more bloodthirsty than any cartel: communist China. 

But first, the cultural and political upheavals that that made the the U.S. populace susceptible to China‚Äôs predations.

Odd for a democracy, the American ruling class is largely composed of privileged individuals who loathe their constituents. Since the 90s, terrible trade deals, offshoring, globalisation, automation, and mass immigration resulted in a stagnant economy, (for the bottom 50%, it was moribund). There was little to no real wage growth for anyone not a corporate exec, and income inequality accelerated. (Trends that have reversed over the last 4 years.)

Americans then had their kids shipped overseas to fight wars in countries they never heard of; some came home maimed, many were shellshocked by their experience, and worse they didnt even know why. This convergence of events created for the existential dread Americans felt for the future; for the first time, they believed their kids would have a tougher life than they did. In a society that de-emphasized traditional structures like religion, they desperately needed emotional relief, courtesy of Big Pharma.

Egregious overprescribing remained common for most of the 2000s, and not jus painkillers, though. Every negative emotion suddenly found a pharmaceutical remedy. A case of the blues was reinterpreted as clinical depression. Kids with short-attention spans (I.e. kids) and lazy students were given low-grade meth. Anyone that went thru a hard breakup had a bottle of xannies to ameliorate anxiety. It‚Äôs crazy how easy it was to get a script for any narcotic in these halcyon days.

The sudden spike in overdose deaths from oxycontin (particularly the 80mg instant release formula) brought a slew of lawsuits and increased scrutiny, which caused the feds to overcorrect in prescribing guidelines. Law-abiding Americans who were denied their pain meds after years of use suddenly found themselves in the throes of withdrawal, strung out like any dope sick junkie.

They tried to get relief any way they could find it. For many, pills on the black market were much too expensive to maintain the habit they had developed under medical supervision. So they turned to the cheaper alternative: heroin.

However, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to overstate how deadly China‚Äôs intervention in this supply chain has been. A heroin epidemic is much different than an opiod epidemic. The margin between an active dose and a lethal one, already slim for heroin, is basically nonexistent for fentanyl. Meaning, the dose required to get high is nearly identical to the minimum dose that‚Äôll kill you.

Fentanyl is not new, and for a long time, it was marketed and known as China White, which it still is. In fact, I think it‚Äôs at the center of the criminal enterprise in that famous Bruce Lee movie. But new technologies and recent policy have granted China a de facto monoply on fentanyl; the dark web has made widespread distribution both feasible and profitable. It‚Äôd be more accurate to say China invented the modern fentanyl market.

Fentanyl is not jus responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths; it‚Äôs also made the dope game much more lucrative for any enterprising, unscrupulous dealer without cartel connections.

Browsing any darknet market reveals scores of wholesale fent vendors based in China, selling small quantities of a gram to large ones of a kilo. (Any other vendor of the opiod and its analogues are just middle-men between the Asian wholesalers and American buyers: they simply put a huge markup‚Äì like 200%‚Äìon the wholesale price in exchange for faster, more reliable, and trackable shipping options.)

Considering their draconian drug policy and surveillance state, this Chinese monopoly hasnt resulted due to the ambition of enterprising criminal cartels; it‚Äôs tacitly supported by the Chinese government and encouraged by the CCP‚Äôs hostility towards the West. Unlike, say, Colombian cocaine, the production of fentanyl does not rely upon local plantlife, and requires highly sophisticated laboratories.

In fact, (per wikipedia), fentanyl is nearly impossible to manufacture in an illicit lab because it‚Äôs a notoriously difficult compound to synthesize. In comparison, the production of LSD is easier by multiple factors.

The implication being: Chinese fentanyl production occurs in government- or government-sanctioned labs. In fact, until the last trade negotiation with the U.S., fentanyl was legal to manufacture in China, designated a commercial product, instead of a narcotic. If I remember right, it was this specific term to the new trade agreement that the Chinese reneged on, which provoked the U.S. during negotiations. 

In what is now a familiar pattern to anyone paying attention this past year, the Chinese government prohibited the sale of fentanyl domestically, while exporting death abroad. Chinese companies manufactured fentanyl, carfentanil, and other analogues with the tacit approval of the government, who classified it as some kind of consumer product rather than a pharmaceutical or narcotic. They then accessed a foreign customer base via dark web markets and sold it by the kilo thru these and other murky, illicit channels that utilized cryptocurrency for anonymity.

In short, the Chinese Communist Party is waging a sort of chemical warfare on the West by making readily available the most potent opiods known to man for pennies on the dollar.

A few years ago, you could find a kilo of fent going for a couple grand on the dark web, which is the kind of deal unscrupulous dealers salivate over. They could hit that 10 times over with cut and be left with a product still stronger than most street heroin, in a quantity with a street value of over a half million dollars.

If the U.S. were doing this to another country, there‚Äôd be social justice mobs condemning it as proof positive of our moral deficiency as a racist and imperialist society. 

And yet‚Ä¶on it goes, year after year, 50,000 dead, and it barely gets mentioned on a national stage. I think Trump is the first politician to have actually said the word ‚Äúfentanyl‚Äù aloud, let alone within the context of China.

What‚Äôs especially disconcerting is China‚Äôs brazen approach to this modern kind of chemical warfare. Theyre completely unapologetic about it; the legality of manufacturing fent is their worst kept secret. Their superpower aspirations find an outlet in causing cultural chaos in their main political rival.

But since dealers in the U.S. are the ones hitting their product with fentanyl, and American junkies love the potency, our leaders just shrug and never mention what‚Äôs happening.

I suspect this is partly China‚Äôs revenge upon the Anglo world for the Opium Wars a century or two ago. Britain‚Äôs unscrupulous business practices lead to widespread opium use among native Chinese, the country was essentially in thrall to the drug; it‚Äôs estimated this episode set China back generations.

But this has got me wondering, has the U.S. already ceded dominance to China? When the smoke clears from the pandemic and we can assess the facts soberly, will countries already value an alliance with China more than the U.S., which they see as a civilization in terminal decline? 

And when I consider my own role in this epidemic, more as an unthinking actor drowned by a cultural tidal wave, I try to remember how I even reached that point to be in that position. America has a bad habit of imprisoning its drug users; it‚Äôd probably be more productive to ask what lead them to use drugs so destructively.

That person in my PSI seems foreign to me now, but both Jeff and me were afforded the upbringing of the upper-middle class. With all that privilege, why‚Äôd we risk it for a Russian Roulette of a high? Perhaps more damning, what sort of society have we produced where a sizeable proportion of us have already considered the risk worth it, risking death in exchange for an hour or two of worry-free, pain free euphoria?

Abusing drugs and being creative is weird. It‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt go hand in hand. Yet they complement one another so inadequately that when you want to do your ‚Äúbest work‚Äù you‚Äôre too far gone to know how to execute it.

Darkness doesn‚Äôt discriminate and no matter how much that sugar brings you up, darkness will always be there waiting with open arms to bring you back down, and as sure you‚Äôre still dancing with the devil that is that brown powder - darkness will prevail and overtake that ecstatic powdery artificial light pretending to nurture your soul. Darkness will always find a way, and rest assured, that powdery substance at the bottom of your gut won‚Äôt be there to guide you when that makeshift sun turns to night.¬†




I still look back on all those nights with cravings and euphoria inside my mind and that devil in my subconscious (as the recovering refer to it as) laughs at both those struggles in which I face. Trying to convince me to wrongfully treasure those drug fuelled nights, I feel him prodding at me to remind me to treat each night like a relic of memories I could still recapture all in the name of R-E-L-A-P-S-E. He ensures my perception of those pastimes still remain flawed and adulterated by a longing to do it all again.¬†




Yet as I learn the trade of recovery - where suddenly I now find myself crying again, smiling again with greater impact, I barter off my loneliness to therapy and trade off the powder for emotion - real emotion, the emotion that hammers home what it means to be human again - how it feels to feel again. I make wholesale changes, talk to the professionals, come clean with family and friends as I strip my whole mind naked - being checked into the care I require having been caught in the net when I couldn‚Äôt see the wood from the trees.¬†




As the days go by, as I accept the care I require, that devil - he still bloody remains, but I observe his laughter as it becomes quieter, his influence as it shrinks in size, he sits there in my subconscious with a busted up compass telling me he knows the way and as the days go by I understand why he can never leave me, because without me he simply doesn‚Äôt know the way. I am his host, I am his advantage. He is my parasite, a cockroach in the depths of the dark side of my spirit. But I understand him better now and he resents that understanding, and it makes him smaller and quieter and almost (almost) entirely irrelevant. But he will never leave. Though some day his tools be of no use and some day he‚Äôll put them down, he‚Äôll never go away. He doesn‚Äôt know where to go without me. He needs me in order to fester but I don‚Äôt need him in order to grow.¬†¬†




Dependency or addiction or whatever you want to call it will live near me forever, but I‚Äôll always know its address.¬†




I am broken. But in treatment I learn that the whole world is. We‚Äôre cracked and fractured and misunderstood and heartbroken and every single day we‚Äôre all suffering in some wild or minor way and it is harrowing. We live unjust existences. We never consented to being born but here we are. We never consented to suffering but we do. We never wanted to be left hurt by the people we love¬† but while pots may break and soil may crumble, the spilt flowers can be salvaged and repotted to find comfort in a warmer sun and growth in a lighter rain.¬†




I read somewhere that no feeling is final. There‚Äôs very little you can‚Äôt fix in this lifetime.¬†




Approach happiness and sadness with equanimity and the powder will have no place. Only you can be your own saviour and guiding light.¬†




Drugs are the lights you search for and chase but never capture.¬†




Sobriety is the light that you nurture from within yourself and you will never be truly lost if you can keep a hold of that light.¬†",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45727962}"

Back when you would wake up and the first thought that went through your mind would be about something other than putting a substance into your body? This is just you talking so you don‚Äôt have to lie. You don‚Äôt even have to answer because you already know. Do you remember the anxiety you would get watching your friends take drugs while you stayed sober? Remember how stupid they all looked and acted after taking said drugs? Remember being the sober friend? Remember being a friend? You always said it was a phase and that you would move on eventually. It‚Äôs well passed eventually. What‚Äôs it going to take to bring you back? Do you really want to come back or are you just telling yourself and everyone around you that you do to avoid facing the reality of how shitty you are? People can and will tell you over and over again that you aren‚Äôt a piece of shit but they aren‚Äôt the ones who have to live with it. Ya know, live with the things you‚Äôve done. The things that you use as an excuse to keep using everyday. Well, those things aren‚Äôt the only excuse. You know that though. You already know everything I‚Äôm going to write down before I write it. And then some. That‚Äôs because you are me and I am you. We may not have the same addiction, the same upbringing, we may come from different backgrounds, I grew up poor as to where you may or may not have grown up wealthy but we do share one thing regardless of who we were before. We share the same story. I feel like addicts understand each other better then we allow ourselves to believe. To the overworked mother raising three kids, I know you‚Äôre stressed and tired. You work all day just to come home, cook, clean and everything in between. You feel like you‚Äôve earned that glass of wine and a couple xanax after every night. To the crackhead who roamed the hot streets all day collecting bottles and change for 10+ hours with the sun beating on your back. You feel like you‚Äôve earned that $10 rock. You‚Äôre two completely different people yet you share one common thing. Now I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and tell you that I know everything that there is to know about drug addiction but I will tell you one thing; I know more about it then any doctor or therapist who hasn‚Äôt dealt with it themselves. Aren‚Äôt those ones your favorite? The people that think they can help you quit even though they‚Äôve never felt the pain of a withdrawal? They‚Äôve never stolen from someone they loved just to get high for a few hours. They‚Äôve never come home to an abusive spouse or parent. Yet, they think with a little rehab and help from your ‚ÄúHigher Power‚Äù it‚Äôs possible. But you know that to some of us it‚Äôs just not possible. A lot of us are going to die this way. It‚Äôs so crazy because you know that you want to stop more then anything but at the end of the day the voice in our head always pulls us back. It‚Äôs just too bad we aren‚Äôt strong enough to silence it. Maybe one day we will be though. At least we know people overcome this somehow almost everyday. We are in this together. Even though we don‚Äôt know each other, never heard of one another and probably never will. As addicts it‚Äôs in our nature to cling on to people like us. Which is really sad because we get to know and love these people but regardless chances are we are bound to lose them.

People say it‚Äôs a threefold disease: body, mind, and spirit. I just see the mind and spirit.

When it comes to the ‚Äúphysical craving‚Äù I have the effect that it describes of having more than I set out to and not being able to stop. The issue is that I still think that‚Äôs a mental issue and has nothing to do with the body. 

And evidently scientists have discovered that the alcoholics body breaks down alcohol slower and leaves it as an enzyme longer leaving us thirsty for more or something. I‚Äôve listened to the joe and Charlie tape. But what about drugs? I have the same effect with drugs. What about video games? I have the EXACT same thing happen to me with video games. I don‚Äôt have a gambling addiction but what about them? What about the process addictions?

Now you can say the feeling of euphoria can be physical and that is felt in the mind and you get that from the process addiction. But I still see it as my perception (mind) that is changing. And as a result my spiritual malady is unseen and I want more. 

And if you actually listen to speakers who know what they‚Äôre talking about you‚Äôll hear that alcoholism and drug addiction has nothing to do with the chemicals - right. It‚Äôs the restlessness irritability and discontented ness. The feeling and loneliness and depression that I experience, unless if I have a psychic change, will drive me back to the substance at some point. So if the disease is something that can be experienced in a sober state, I just see it all in my mind. I may say ‚ÄúI feel bad‚Äù, ‚ÄúI feel miserable‚Äù, ‚ÄúI feel like dying‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI feel depressed‚Äù but is that really a feeling? Or is it just something that the mind perceives?

Upon writing this I feel like even the spiritual malady is something perceived through the mind too. 

Any input is greatly appreciated. I ask people in my support network and they seem to want to just dismiss it or give me answers that are frustrating and juvenile in origin. It‚Äôs a question that just keeps frustrating me that I can‚Äôt drop and really makes me feel depressed hopeless and misunderstood to not have the answer that everyone around me just doesn‚Äôt even second guess the validity of",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5440805}"

My brother has recently (about three months ago) overdosed on meth, having what the paramedic said was a meth-induced psychotic breakdown. He used to be a New York lawyer working at a big firm making lots of money but lost his job a year ago and this happened the day after he officially filed for bankruptcy. Pretty sure it was a cry for help. During that episode as we were talking on the phone he shared his location with me on Apple. 

After that, he stayed with our sister in a small town for about a month and cleaned the meth out of his system. He used to complain that it was boring. Eventually, he moved closer to me for a job, living with an old friend. Right around Christmas he left that friends‚Äô house and has been bouncing around hotels, ‚Äúlooking for a place to stay‚Äù. He told me he was going to stay with the owner of the company as soon as the apartment was built (I guess it‚Äôs a new build) but the move in date was pushed back until Jan 18. I told him he could stay here with me until then and he borrowed $300 for the trip up here because he doesn‚Äôt have a car. He said he was having dinner with a hotel owner who was going to let him stay for half price this weekend. He‚Äôs supposed to come up on Monday.

So just tonight he turned off his location. I am spinning out worrying because I gave him money and the story isn‚Äôt sitting right.

Would appreciate any words of wisdom (though please refrain from single line responses like ‚Äúdude u should stop taking adderall‚Äù )
I know I‚Äôm not the only one so any one who struggles or better yet has made it through the other side of something like this I would love to hear from.

  We are 16 years together, both 33 years old, no children, both chefs. Our sexual relations have been normal (2 to 3 times a week) for quite some time. I discovered my husband who watched pornography, when we were still dating and it became a problem, since when we finished having sex, he expected i to leave the house to see pornography, we had many and many and many fights, but He always told me that he was trying to quit and I decided to believe. In March-April we were both unemployed, since the restaurant where we work closed, but it was not a difficult situation, on the contrary we saw it as a vacation, money was not a problem. In those months he did not look for me sexually, nor did he see that I had a need for sex and that is where I began to doubt. In September one night I surprised him masturbating while he watched pornography while we slept in the same bed (I was asleep) on that occasion my only reason why, I continued the relationship was because he started going to psychological therapy and I even told him that although it was difficult For me, if he felt the need or urge to tell me, that I would try to help him or that if he saw pornography he should tell me since I am aware of his problem, but he never sought my help, nor did he prove that I could understand him. In November he had to go to the United States for work and I stayed in Mexico, the separation was very ugly for me, since we have always worked in the same place, therefore we are almost always together, but we give ourselves moments to do whatever each one wants. I came to the United States 3 months later (December) to be with him, even though I had plans to start a business and leave my family (my father and my sisters). ilhe said that he would never do it again and that he was really trying to quit.

Yesterday I discovered him looking at his cell phone at 2 am, when I asked for his cell phone, I found an application to hide all your information that you see on the internet (as he did not have time to close it). When confronted, he told me that he had not bought it for that, he pay 90 dlls for this application, after talking and showing him evidence that he only used that application in the early morning, I accept it, but he says it was to see cartoon pornography (Hentai) that he thought it was less ugly than seeing real people. I don't know what to do, in general he's a good person. He does not smoke, he does not drink, he does not miss work, he is not a waste of money, he does not treat me badly, he is kind to me and to others, in short I think he is a good person. But the problem of pornography is something serious for me, why is he already paying to have access to it, he preferred to masturbate to have sex with me, for a while he would just lie down and let me do all the work to have sex Even for me it was difficult to get aroused, why did I have to focus on him, his constant lies and not knowing if I can sleep without him watching pornography. All the fights we have had over this issue are quite strong and I always have the feeling that I am not enough and my self-esteem is always damaged. I feel sad and disappointed and with a feeling of emptiness, why do we have very satisfactory relationships, but he continues to see pornography, he has accepted that he has a problem and that if it were up to him he would see pornography every day and masturbate 2 times per day. I don't know what to do, help !!! I know that he has a problem, an addiction and that I have to help him, but it is a constant emotional drain for me and it has been 16 years giving opportunities and well we continue in the same or worse, why now, Ihebuy an application to try to deceive myself , even more. I do not like to see other men, even on the internet and the truth is that I am not easily attracted to men, so he has not had to deal with any similar problem, I strive to be physically attractive to him, doing daily exercise Healthy eating, but not to the extreme, being an intellectual challenge for him, we share many hobbies such as video games, comics, anime, board games. But yes, he prefers to have a double life and continue to watch pornography. I return to Mexico and he separated me from him or I give him another chance.

I am a 16 year old teenager who strives to be a psychologist. From a really young age, I got addicted to video games and later on my teen years to my mobile phone. For most of the duration of this phenomenon, I remained fully in denial until recently. The long term effects of such addictions have started to show, to the point where people like my friends or parents could notice. Even me, who I was deeply in denial all this years realize in what kind of mess I am in. My parents have been really lenient towards me, placing faith in me that I will moderate the time I spend on such activities. I took advantage of that and in result, especially around my late elementary and early middle school years, I started developing  psychological and educational gaps. I missed on really fundamental teachings about my language and I struggle everyday to write with proper spelling or phrase certain words. I was also enclosed in the comfort of my room for my early teen years, avoiding all possible social contact with my friends and family. My already diminished social skills started to decile even more so, to the point where I would start sweating nervously when girls would try to talk to me. All in all, I don't regret the things I've done, perhaps it could've turned out way better for me if I had taken a more wise approach. But now, with my birthday around the corner and corona close to my doorstep, I am starting to really worry about my future self. I've tried several times to quit such activities but such attempts proved to be futile. Because of how I'm forced into my own room, a place where I've associated unproductive behaviors, because of the lockdown, and how pretty much every academic process is taking place on the internet, I am unable to distance myself from technology as much as I want to. All of my friends are on social media, I cannot bear the thought of not being able to contact them. I wanted to reach out to a psychologist, shedding some light onto this matter and listening to what a professional would have to say about my condition would make me feel a lot more contempt with myself, but that also proved futile. Past psychological trauma is also affecting my mental health, I find myself daydreaming constantly for some reason about a life where all of this is over and that I am happy with myself. My motivation is usually short-lived and it comes in waves, so it's really hard to stick to productive activity to long periods of time. This whole situation usually drives me into a really pessimistic and almost nihilistic mental state that usually goes away after I rest a little bit and think things over. I am seriously lost, sick and tired of this situation and will listen to anyone who is willing to offer me advise or some insight. If you want any more information on the points I've made, please do not hesitate to ask.",4,"{'rona': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.52891326}"

You‚Äôve been with me my whole life. I knew you were there everyday.

But for so long you were hiding, waiting for the moment to strike.

When my world started to fall apart, you saw your opportunity.

I saw what you did to my family. 

You turned my father into a monster. You turned my siblings into strangers.

You broke my mother‚Äôs heart.

All the pain you caused me, and I still fell for your tricks. You made me feel good when nothing else did. 

You made it stop hurting.

You saved me. You gained my confidence. 

Because of you I found happiness. I found friendships. Memories that will last a lifetime.

But what you didn‚Äôt say is that you‚Äôd take it all away.

You kept me away from the truth. You didn‚Äôt take the pain away. You kept it hidden and locked away. You kept it so you could stop me when I tried to leave you.

Every time I leave, you open it. My own Pandora‚Äôs box. 

You release every pain, every heartbreak, so that I come back to you. And I always did.  

You‚Äôd rather us both die, then have me leave you.

But it‚Äôs time. 

You turned me into a monster. 

Just as you did with my father. 

People don‚Äôt recognize me anymore. You‚Äôve turned me into a stranger. 

Just as you did with my siblings.

You break the hearts of the people I love. 

Just as you did with my mother.

When I‚Äôm with you, I love the way I feel.

But I hate the person that I become.

Everything you gave me, I ruined. Friendships fell apart, my happiness faded, and the good memories ceased to be. All that was left was the pain. 

You knew that I would come back because you told me you would always be there. That you‚Äôd always take away the pain.

You‚Äôre a liar.

But I loved the way you lied. So much so that those lies became my truth. I was happy. I was loved. 

I was better.

But I won‚Äôt let you lie to me anymore.

The truth is painful. The box is still emptying. I face a new pain everyday.

And I still hear you calling my name. But each day your voice gets quieter. 

For the first time in a long time, I‚Äôm smiling without you.

The day of our first date, long story short, he completely stood me up. I tried texting and calling him but didn‚Äôt hear anything at all. I figured he was just a total jerk and didn‚Äôt like me for whatever reason. But it made no sense because he acted like he liked me so much and we seemed to have such a strong connection.

Then a few days later he called and told me he has a meth addiction and he relapsed the day of our date. He was too high to come on our date and instead just felt really ashamed and wanted to hide.

44 days ago I threw away my stash and pledged to live a better way. Tomorrow will be the halfway point to 90 days, which I hear is the first crucial milestone for quitting an addiction forever. It's been an interesting journey with some ups and downs. I've had days where I was craving and on the verge of picking up, followed by days of profound relief and pride that I didn't. I've been wired some days, and been totally lethargic on others. One thing I noticed is that I'm having super vivid dreams, which probably seem more vivid because of the years of dreamless, comatose sleep I'd been having. More nightmares than I ever used to have, but that's not a huge deal. Ultimately, I do feel a lot better now, not to mention the fact I'm saving money and not panicking about paying my bills every month (not as much, at least).

If you're reading this in the grip of an addiction, all I can tell you from my experience so far is that it is totally worth giving up. I'm not gonna tell you it's easy, I'm not gonna tell you everything gets better immediately. But it's like having a hangover. Your body is getting a chance to get all the poison out of its system, you just have to ride it out to see the benefit. Nobody regrets kicking addiction after it's out of their system.

When i‚Äôm sober all i wanna do is smoke and do the things i do and don‚Äôt think of it badly but the second i‚Äôm high or when i first get a vape or even after masturbating i feel horrible and i know i need to stop and want to stop and the thoughts consume and rip me apart when i‚Äôm high but yet i still continue to get high and do these things while knowing i should stop and it‚Äôs ruining me. i seriously need some help/tips and true motivation to finally start my journey of quitting and becoming a productive not self conscious person. Please help out it‚Äôs killing me. If i was never in this position i would be honestly a much better and accomplished person",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.896779}"

I‚Äôll try to keep this short, but I‚Äôm really emotional right now, and want to let it out in order to help you understand the situation. 

My friend and I are best mates from the past 12 years. 12 years of sleeping over at each other‚Äôs place, 12 years of keeping each other‚Äôs back, and 12 years of love poured out from both of us. 

Now, we have been smokers from over six years, but around 3 years back, we decided to try out different drugs. I liked hashish, and he unfortunately fell head over heels over cocaine. 

I‚Äôve always known this guy to be strong - mentally and physically - and we weren‚Äôt taking drugs regularly, so it was supposed to be all okay, right? But no, before I knew it he had fallen down the hole and became an addict before anyone around him even realised it. 

Around 3 months back, his brother realised the gravity of the situation and decided to intervene. He was taken to a psychiatrist for treatment, and my friend said that he was getting better - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel the need for coke anymore‚Äù. 

Sadly, it was a lie and he has been continually keeping it up. I tried to talk him through but I‚Äôve always been afraid of getting straight with him as ‚Äúmates‚Äù aren‚Äôt supposed to dictate one another‚Äôs life, right? 

I tried to spend some days over at his place to offer a change of environment around him so that he doesn‚Äôt have an external trigger for his urges. But, he still broke down and ended up taking a dose. 

I couldn‚Äôt fathom the idea that I might be losing my friend, and had a complete emotional breakdown in front of him. I had never cried in front of him, and I thought this might have ended up helping him as he swore on me that he won‚Äôt touch coke again. 

However, I was wrong and I think that my breakdown might‚Äôve pushed us away from one another. We planned to meet up on NYE and have a good time, but he ditched the plan on the last day and spent it with another group of his. 

His brother later told me that he had still been using coke, and he did so on NYE too. Maybe, he doesn‚Äôt want me around him as I would of course try to stop him. 

I‚Äôve been extremely frustrated over the past week. On one side, I had my NYE plans flushed - which I didn‚Äôt see coming as he was ALWAYS been understanding - and he is lying and choosing to move apart from me. However, he‚Äôs still my best mate. I cannot imagine losing this guy, and I know that synthetic drugs can alter your brain/mindset. 

How do you think I can, or should approach this situation? Should I give him space, or does he need me to support him? How should I support him? 

Moreover, what‚Äôs the recovery process? The treatment centres in our area are shit. He‚Äôll most probably get the care workers to bring him drugs. 

His family is extremely soft. His parents have tried ‚Äútalking‚Äù him through but he doesn‚Äôt listen to them anymore. His brother tried to stop him but his efforts have been in vain too. 

I‚Äôm just at a loss right now because I have literally no idea how to tackle this situation. I wanted to post this here so I could get a chance to talk to you guys who have been through the recovery process or a similar situation. I just don‚Äôt want to lose my friend.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4738002}"

He had a stint in rehab for 30 days a few years back but unfortunately that's where he met his girlfriend, who is also a meth addict. He also entered a detox facility on Christmas eve and stayed, very reluctantly, for 5 days. Walked away from another potential rehab .

My question to you guys who have gone thru this: What, as his uncle, can I possibly do to help him? Does forced rehab work? How about psilocybin or other psychedelic drugs that may help him? Does anyone have experience with contingency management therapy? You could only imagine my brother's(his dad) state right now. Already lost a son and headed in that direction again.

I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd go about three days to a week on, and the same amount of time off. Give or take. I was using cocaine, Xanax, klonipin, and opiates when I could get my hands on them. A few days after graduation I fucked around with some pressed 30‚Äôs and woke up 6 hours later in the hospital confused. Then again two days later. 

For almost 6 months I was able to stay away from everything besides the occasional drink or weed (I was away at college). One month short of what would have been my 6 month sober date, I bought a gram of cocaine and a few days after I bought 20 Xanax bars. After that I was able to stop for a couple months.

In the first month of March, I had a small relapse. I bought 9 bars of Xanax and ducked out for a few days. I skipped some of my classes and just stayed at my dorm. On the last day, I had 5 left. I really don‚Äôt remember how, but I ended up taking all 5. And I showed up to my dance class fucking gone. I made an ass of myself and I was so ashamed. Luckily, my teacher showed mercy and took me to the counseling people. They ended up calling an ambulance which pissed me off because I DIDNT need it. I had enough of a tolerance. But that‚Äôs the event that did it for me for good. 

Now, it‚Äôs been 10 months since I dabbled back. And I miss it a lot. I still don‚Äôt wanna be sober. I hate having to be alone with my thoughts. All I want is to get loaded.

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm a 23-year-old recent college graduate. 

To begin, I have a friend from high school who I recently reconnected with in 2020. When he messaged me on Facebook I was happy to hear from him since it had literally been years since he graduated high school and we never really hung out after that, until kinda recently.

He messaged me and told me about going to jail for awhile for trying to steal something while he was homeless and on a high dose of DXM. But that it was behind him (everyone thinks it‚Äôs just that easy) and he‚Äôd been at a recovery living community home for 8 months, before soon he was getting out of there (in May). We kept in touch, but this was in March. I wouldn‚Äôt actually see him in person until I ran out of a weed dealer in my area and he was a short drive away from me... 
His history of drugs is very extensive, he‚Äôd tried just about everything and been hooked on several things, but mainly alcohol and DXM. After his time at this facility his plan was to just start out with weed and maybe build into psychedelics like LSD or Shrooms. 

I bought weed from him like twice a week for about 3 months. We‚Äôd chat often and strike up conversations about the past. Here recently he was basically falling off of the deep end. 

Well, yesterday I went to buy weed in the early morning from him (we both work 3rd shift). I get there and he reminded me that he was going to go to rehab later that day. So, we talked some more about it and I was 100% convinced he was going in, but of course I had to make sure (my idea was to call him before he went in). 

So, after I bought the weed from him he asked me to take him to the local Walmart as he didn‚Äôt have a vehicle (I didn‚Äôt ask why because he‚Äôs always been pretty poor). So, I take him there and as I turn off the ignition he tells me ‚Äúyou know how I‚Äôm paying for this, right? You don‚Äôt have to come in‚Äù. So I stay in the car while he goes in to steal something (I didn‚Äôt judge lol). He comes back out to my car and gets in the passenger seat. 

He pulls out a 2-pk of air duster from under his shirt and asks if he can hit it in the car while on the way back. 
{I knew some of the effects of the stuff, but I thought it was like those canisters out of whip cream and just produced like a head high that made you feel a little bit drunk and kinda psychedelic for a few seconds and passed quickly. I was BIG TIME WRONG and learned that those effects might only be felt at very small huffs. Not knowing much about this stuff I played it smart and asked for him to only take very small hits}

He kindly agrees to and we are on our way to drop him back off at his apartment. On the way there he takes some small hits of the can and we listen to some music, he turns it up a little because I think I was talking too much by asking him what exactly the effects of that stuff felt like because I was just curious. We get to his apartment after some rough directions of where exactly to go and all of the parking spots are filled nearby, so as I loop around and I start to notice him hitting this duster longer. I‚Äôm about 10 feet from the space closed to his apartment going about 10 mph and he begins to try to step out of my car. I throw the car in park as he‚Äôs stumbling and moaning getting out of the car. I get out and yell for him to sit down in the car so he doesn‚Äôt fall and crack open his head. 
So, he manages to get in the car and mumbles some stuff to me and starts hitting this stuff some more. I frantically yell out and say, ‚Äúhey man can you please not do that in my car, you kinda just freaked me out a second ago‚Äù. His face when he turned to me looked like something out of a nightmare. He looked pissed as hell, a look I‚Äôve never seen on him. He always listens to me and respects me as a good friend, and this time around really just threw me off. As he‚Äôs staring at my face he says something under his breathe and mumbles some before getting out a sentence like ‚Äúfuck you man, you look at me like a low-life who just huffs air duster, but honestly I‚Äôd rather huff this than hang out with your stupid ass‚Äù. 

As an up and coming social worker I knew not to take any of this to heart and just worried about what‚Äôs happening to him. He then gets out of my car again (stumbling again of course)  and starts to walk towards his apartment. After about 10 feet of walking away, he turns toward my car (idk if he just took a big hit of this air duster or what happened) and just starts yelling at the top of his lungs. I could only make out a few cuss words as I turned toward him and watched him walk away further. He got about another 30 feet out before turning towards me again and screaming and yelling even louder (but it didn‚Äôt look like he was exactly facing my car). He turned away after I rolled up my window and walks up to his apartment. Now that he‚Äôs there I felt a short sense of comfort before leaving. 

While driving back to my place, I call his phone hoping those effects go away long enough for him sober up for a few minutes or something to understand what happened to not hit that canister again so we can get him into rehab ASAP. 
I get back to my place and I finished an 8 hour 3rd shift that night prior to this (remember it‚Äôs still like 8:30 in the morning). So I‚Äôm tired as hell and decide I‚Äôll nap as soon as I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs okay. He messaged me back that he was going to go to sleep pretty soon and that what happened earlier were mood swings from hitting this stuff too much. Alright, he‚Äôs coherent, I felt better. 
Still urgently messaging him I ask him to call me later so I know he‚Äôs going to rehab. I fall asleep and wake up to him calling me at 3:30 telling me to come pick him up to go to rehab. I excitingly said ‚Äúhell yes‚Äù and went on my way. When I get to him, he‚Äôs at the Burger King across the street from his apartment where he told me he wanted me to meet him at. He gets in my car again and looks at me and says ‚ÄúMan, I don‚Äôt even remember a single thing about walking in and out of that place‚Äù. 

I start to get some anxiety, but talk to him more and find out that he actually passed out in his place earlier that day while I was asleep and the cops had just been there to wake him up and take his 6 air duster cans. His roommate kicked him out and his stuff was packed at his 'former' place. He also told me he lost his job in fast food recently and things have just gone down hill. He talked briefly about a situation where he wrecked his friends car. I directly asked him if it was air can related and he said ‚Äúno, man‚Äù. I just took a heavy dose of LSD the night before and I‚Äôd drive his vehicle the next day and just kinda blackout for a few seconds. I was pretty suspicious of this story, but I let it fly. He didn‚Äôt seem like he was on anything at the time so it was a nice conversation. He then informs me that he won‚Äôt be able to meet with his personal AA counselor to go to the rehab until 6PM because the guy is coming from the place and it‚Äôs like and hour away. The plan was to meet him at the Walmart parking lot. All sounded good, I‚Äôd stay in my car and just drive around and chat with my friend until rehab. Not really... 

{Addiction is rough. I understand this to a very small extent just with nicotine. Like to quit a nicotine addiction I feel like I have to get that perfect nic hit that has you just drooling before giving it up for awhile. I‚Äôve been able to get off of it for several months by not half-assing (my pod runs out or summin') my last hit so I feel like I get it out of my system (lmao, kinda silly, I know). So, in this case, my friend now wanted to do that, but with his ‚Äòdrugs of choice by environment‚Äô}

He asked for me to take him to the local Walmart that‚Äôs like 8 minutes away. When we got there I asked what he was buying. He wanted to steal some cough syrup. Not having any control of the conversation or being able to stop him, I agree to let him go in and get it. He said he‚Äôd just get the small bottle that was 400ml, I think. Which he‚Äôs a big guy, so I was kind of cool with it, but I‚Äôd heard it can sometimes cause mood swings and aggressive behavior. So I was hesitant when he got back in my car with it after stealing it. I asked him not to take it if he was going to take it until 30 minutes before 6 PM so I wouldn‚Äôt have to be near him when it hits. He tried to lie and say it took 2 hours before it kicked in, but I knew that didn‚Äôt sound right. I know how long it takes different things to be absorbed into the body lol. I told him that, he understood and agreed to my terms. 

Things were going well! We drive out to a nearby park to kill some time and walk around and talk about life. We had fun, until he mentioned he had a little bit of weed he wanted to smoke before going to rehab. Having tried it myself, I was fine with this. He asked if I wanted any, I turned him down because I didn‚Äôt want to fuck up this opportunity for him. We go into the empty bathroom about 250 feet from this bathroom. There were a few families around so I kind of stood guard and probably looked a bit high-strung, while he goes into the corner to pack a bowl. He struggles to unclog the bowl, but I remember that I had some toothpicks in the car, so I run out to get them. I kind of do this at a fast pace because I want to keep my eyes on him and my car was about a 2 minute jog away. 

When I get back to the bathroom I can hear him screaming (the kind you make when you go down a rollercoaster) in the stall of the bathroom with the door closed. As I walked in I heard that damn ‚ÄúPshhhhhh‚Äù air can noise and got instant anxiety. My head gets a wild rush of adrenaline and I walk outside for a second to collect my thoughts. I walk back in and ask ‚Äúare you using another air can?‚Äù He said ‚Äúnooooo man nahh‚Äù, then I say ‚Äúbut I heard it going off and you tripping‚Äù. He then lies and says ‚Äúnoooooo‚Äù while giggly and a bit of added aggression in his tone. 

I‚Äôm kind of running out of options. I don‚Äôt want to trip sit him and have him passed out on the bathroom floor dead. I also notice an empty bottle of the 400mg cough syrup on the ground, and his weed is just spilled everywhere on the floor (it was a horrific sight). I get him to stop taking larger hits for a bit while I chat with him across the stall door. He comes to a little bit, but still a little silly. I was able to somehow manage to get the air can by politely asking for him to hand it to me under the stall. I immediately run outside and let him know I‚Äôm disposing of it (which I made sure he knew before he gave it to me). I run to a trash can pretty far out and buried it at the bottom so that if he came out here looking for the stuff, that he wouldn‚Äôt find it. 

I run back into the bathroom as fast as I can and I hear the damn ‚ÄúPshhhhhh‚Äù noise from another air duster can with the added ‚ÄúWOOOOOOOO AHHHH‚Äù sounds he was making before and my heart just completely dropped, why didn‚Äôt I think of him having multiple air dusters? (2pk)? That‚Äôs probably what he also picked up when I took him to the Walmart a bit ago. I pressed 9-1-1 on my phone‚Äôs keyboard, but didn‚Äôt make the call yet. I ran in and out several times knowing I might just have to have the police come so that he doesn‚Äôt kill himself from this stuff. Sure, I could fight him and take it from him, but I‚Äôm a pacifist and that‚Äôd be the last option possible if it really came to it. He‚Äôs twice my body weight FYI. He was passed out cold earlier from this stuff at his apartment, I do not want that to happen again.

I run in and decide, let‚Äôs try to talk to him one last time. I chat with him more and bring him down a little bit. We‚Äôve been in the bathroom for about 30 minutes now. I actually started to cry and he felt really bad and came out, but said some cold stuff like. ‚ÄúYeah man, just leave me here so I can huff this shit and stop being on my ass about it. I‚Äôll just walk to Walmart from here myself (5-7 mile walk). It‚Äôs now 5 PM, remember we have to meet his counselor at 6 PM. So, I ask my friend if I can talk to his counselor.

The sad thing is that my friend has talked to me so many times about how hard it is for him to get help. Sometimes he knows he needs it, but he can never actually get there as of recently. He really wanted to quit everything and get this month of rehab (maybe more, he talked about maybe going 11 months). 

I grab my friends phone and put his Facebook login info into my Facebook and go to his messages to call this counselor dude. I call him and he says he‚Äôs about an hour away (things can never be easy). I hang up and devise of a plan so that he doesn‚Äôt take huge hits of this air duster. I would distract him by bringing up any memory I could of us back in high school.
[  I use to give him rides to and from school and we always had good conversations in my car. He was really smart in school. He got a 36 on the science part of the ACT and a 34 on the entire damn thing, highest in my school (he later told me he did this on an amphetamine). But the point is we had some good memories, and this guy was a true friend I could talk to about anything and he‚Äôd just naturally understand me. ]

To distract my friend while he‚Äôd take some pretty mild hits of this air duster, I‚Äôd talk a lot and try to get him to respond quicker (this was probably a shitty trip for him the way I was acting lol). But we managed and wanted to smoke the rest of the weed, hell, I even packed it for him. Anything but that air duster shit, god damn.

Well, we made it to 6 PM, I let my friend contact all the people he still had in his life and tell them he‚Äôd be gone for the next month. Then two counselor guys show up. 

‚Äî‚ÄîSide note‚Äî‚Äî I‚Äôm from a bible belt state. Lol well, these guys looked like minor characters from the sopranos, the ones who do the dirty work (they‚Äôre old AA buddies of his and one was the counselor I talked on the phone with from the rehab center). They walk in the bathroom and say some shit like ‚Äú____, you look like fucking shit, man‚Äù. They stand him up (lol, I had him sit down because he was stumbling out of that damn stall earlier). They take everything out of his pockets and his pipe. They flush the weed, smash his glass piece on the pavement outside. They also couldn‚Äôt get him to give them his air duster. 

So, he kept it. But they had to make a pit stop at a local mall to get something before going back somewhere away from the city where this rehab facility is at. I follow them and sit with my friend and wait on them to come back to the car. Luckily, the air duster can was on its last leg and I let him hit the rest of it in my car after warming up the bottom of the can with my cars heat vent (it was also freezing outside sooo). I give him an extra vape I‚Äôm trying to quit vaping on and tell him I love him and he‚Äôs a brother from another mother. The counselor gave him a cigarette and that really de-stressed a lot of things. The guys come back out and before they leave I give my friend a goodbye hug until who knows whenever.

This was four days ago now and I mainly wrote this to debrief on the situation, so while I know it‚Äôs long, also understand that this was for my own sanity. Anytime that I may sound jokey or careless, just know I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that the jokes help me with the situation. 

I haven‚Äôt had contact with my friend since, but I‚Äôm hoping to soon. I told him I‚Äôd get our old friend group back together and try to play another game of ultimate frisbee (like we use to do after school each week). 

But has anyone else had or been around someone with a serious Air duster addiction? This was my first time actually around the stuff and I was blown away from how people react to it, that stuff can be lethal as hell.

Any thoughts on the situation? What could I have done better? Any advice on how to interact with him when he gets out of rehab? What‚Äôs the depression like in a rehab facility after you reach this low and lost so many thing? Any and all comments are appreciated! 

If you‚Äôre hooked on this stuff and need help, message me!

2021-01-06 00:31:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/krhawp/some_reflections_on_sobriety_in_the_first_year_id/,Some reflections on sobriety in the first year. I‚Äôd love to hear any similarities/differences you‚Äôve experienced.,"I wrote a reflection on my experience at 300 days sober and I thought it may be an interesting read for you. Almost two years and I can confirm that I‚Äôm still at zero things in my life worsening with sobriety. Happy New Year.

 
300 days. 

It‚Äôs important for me to reflect on these milestones. It separates the monotony of everyday sobriety (because unfortunately, it does get tiresome). It really sucks sometimes, but it‚Äôs good most. My pseudo-mantra (barf) continues to be ‚ÄúI want to build the Dr. Jekyll side of me and stop feeding the Mr. Hyde.‚Äù Maybe you‚Äôre thinking about pursuing a reduction in substances, maybe not. Regardless, some tips and tricks I‚Äôve found through many different periods of sobriety (be it one night or this fucking long haul) are as follows:

	1.	The most pressure to drink is placed on the first round. It feels lonesome and silly to miss out, but hold strong, after your party people have guzzled their inaugural beverage, the stress of drinking shoots down tenfold. Keep it up. 

	2.	Don‚Äôt set unrealistic goals for yourself. One of the best tricks I‚Äôve learned is telling oneself ‚Äújust for today.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust for today, I won‚Äôt drink,‚Äù ‚ÄúJust for today I won‚Äôt smoke,‚Äù ‚ÄúJust for today, the bouncer that I knew in highschool wont have to chuck me out of the bar.‚Äù This sets a much more achievable goal and reduces the imminent feeling of doom that mapping out the entirety of your life tends to have. 

	3.	You‚Äôll lose bloat (usually after the first two weeks). No fussing on a lil extra loving but you come to realise that that extra bloat sure does make you feel groggy and a bit weak. Take a shit ton of underwear pics, baby (or don‚Äôt, whatever, it‚Äôs your body, do what you want, it literally has no impact on me whatsoever). 

	4.	Going out will still be fun, just not as much after midnight. You start to recognise why you delve into substances after having the same conversation with a pal for the fourth time that evening. Dip out free of fomo. Cherish the clear head in the morning (or the groggy one if you wake up in the middle of an REM cycle). 

	5.	You will get offered more drinks than you have in your entire life. Those people are often assholes. Proceed in those friendships with caution.

	6.	You save a ton of money. It‚Äôs not the most important thing but it does ease your wallet a bit. You may start a lottery scratchers addiction. Proceed with expenses with caution. 

	7.	You‚Äôll more than likely lean into another vice (see: caffeine or the aforementioned lottery scratchers). Proceed with that development with caution. 

	8.	You‚Äôll reduce your regret-income. This can get boring. Find other things to get that adrenaline rush that comes with the Sunday Scaries (movement, creation, doing something that scares you like maybe pUPPETEERING)

	9.	Be proud of the progress you‚Äôve made. Two steps forward and one step back. You‚Äôre the only one who has lived with yourself for your entire life and you‚Äôre the only one who will continue to do so. Don‚Äôt measure your progress through anyone else. You‚Äôre not suddenly going to start living someone else‚Äôs life so quit harping on yourself by setting standards based on others successes (because you sure aren‚Äôt accounting for their failures).

	10.	Personally, I‚Äôve had the time to recognise the difficult aspects about myself that I‚Äôve been masking with ‚Äúa good time.‚Äù This has been real fucking tough but I continue to grow. Zero things in my life have gotten worse due to being sober.

 She is the sole provider for the household. She has been struggling financially for some time, largely in part due to debts generated by her sons. Several major catastrophes have happened recently and I know they are barely able to afford groceries right now and I want to help. The problem is actually getting the money to her in a secure way. The guys have her bank account info and so have taken money wired to her. Cash is obviously not an option. They have also cashed cheques made out to her (I assume through banking apps). In the past they have sold gift cards as well. I had thought about literally buying groceries to take out to them, but with the COVID lockdown restrictions (and the guys are not following the rules at all, which makes me uncomfortable) that'd off the table for now.

As a special needs kid I wanted nothing more than to be close to my big sister's they were my protectors, best friend and even guardians when my mom was at work.

Tessa started to consume meth at 13 I was 10 or 11 I don't know her birthday not that it has mattered to me in years.

I'm now 28, she apparently she has reached out to my parents and is in detox.
The reason why she hasn't been in my life at all in the past 4 years is because she stole my tablet, pawned off the tablet and used the sim card like it had a phone but since it didn't she racked up my phone bill to $4000, I had to barrow money to make ends meet even though I got it cut down in half I was on EI at the time.

This was the last straw she treated me, my dad and mom like garbage, her kids was an after thought so much so that I had to listen to my little nephews tell us she was lying in pain and disappointment on Christmas Eve when she said she was coming over.

The worst thing was they were right she chose meth over her family, no little boy should have to be upset on Christmas Eve.

I've had people hurt me, take advantage of me and abuse me all my life because I am mildly cognitively delayed and I have ADHD, no one understands what it's like to be me so naturally I have no issues cutting people out of my life even my parents, it's all the easier since I'm an introvert I've gone months without talking or seeing friends and family.

I didn't expect for my own big sister to hurt me constantly directly and indirectly no one should ever have to worry about being betrayed by family.
I don't want her in my life, I never needed her, she never needed me nor cared about me.

All she wants is her meth sure she'll go through the motions to seem like she's getting better but that's when like always she takes advantage.

I cannot reconcile what she has done to this family and I don't want her to be in my life regardless of her going to rehab, she could've been dead in a ditch all of these years and all I feel is apathy.

I was seeing this guy for the past 8 months by seeing  I mean as in casually. He constantly wanted to do cocaine. At first it was fun but then it became excessive. When I would say no he would always make a bargain and say one last time.  All the signs were there that he had a problem. I for some reason chose to ignore them or not see them. 

He would lie to his friends about what he was up to just to do it. Went as far renting a motel to do it so his roommate wouldn‚Äôt know. He even asked me for money once to buy them. 

The last time we saw each other he confessed he was a recovering heroin addict. Says he hasn‚Äôt touched it in 8 years. Then he tried to justify his cocaine use by saying it‚Äôs not addictive and he could stop when he wants. I‚Äôm sure it has become a problem. 

I told him I would no longer be doing that with him or enabling his behavior.  He agreed and said it was stupid and didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore. A week later he texts me and says let‚Äôs do it one last time and stopping will be his New Years resolution. I turned him down and said we already talked about this.

I will get straight to the point: I smoked weed for two years almost every day. 2/3 months I popped pills, but not how most people do it, I used to take halves or quarter every day for a couple of weeks just to be high, not passed out, but euphoric, energized, happy basically. I couldn't feel that happiness without the little boost of serotonin, dopamine. I remember one night we got a bag full of MDMA the crystal and me and some mates smoked it in joints and swallowed it, combined with alcohol. I've done LSD once, coke twice and balloons twice, but the second time was only at a party. 

I can't say I have been clean on weed - and on that note every time I have a drink, I can't stop drinking, that's why I don't do it often, or if I do it, I end up doing it daily - I feel at my best when I smoke it and I feel focused the most if I microdose it, but I cut it a lot and I mean a lot, because of my boyfriend, but now, because of the lockdown (I live in the UK) I can't get my hands even on weed in my area, because I never hang around here, all my dealers are around my college which is a 1h 30m journey. 

I don't want to smoke weed anymore, because I am too used to it, therefore my body's craving for something stronger, I want to do coke again.

I'm inclined to say yes, but I'm very worried about the stigma. I don't want people to know. I'm afraid I won't get a job in my field again if they know about this.


My best friends work in the same area, so if I tell them, I'm afraid other people will end up knowing about it. Hell, I'm worried even about my family knowing.

Have you ever been to rehab? How did you deal with that? Did it affect your career?

one of my biggest regrets is the fact that all this must be hidden from my family due to the scrutiny i would undergo and the punishments . also  my dad has become pastor of a church recently and now they say me and my brother must represent the church and all of Christian kind  which has put even more stress on my shoulders, those factors combined with them putting even more pressure on me do well in school and when i complain about anything about they always go on about how im all about drama and all i want to do is cause problems, they dont believe i have problems and they think that my life is to easy however recently i have been under a lot of mental stress.

They said ‚Äúit‚Äôs like a burst of energy, a rush that takes your breath, it‚Äôs the best feeling ever.

I don‚Äôt know how to explain it really.‚Äô And they were right.

But now if someone were to ever ask me what it‚Äôs like, I would tell them.

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs like spending every single penny you ever had, on drugs.

It‚Äôs like going days without eating even though you were starving, but you needed dope more.

It‚Äôs like having to lie to every family and friend you had ever had.

It‚Äôs like waking up hating yourself from the shame and guilt.

It‚Äôs like going into withdrawals every 8 hours unless you had more dope to do. (And you usually didn‚Äôt)

It‚Äôs like never attending any family event because you were too high or too sick.

It‚Äôs like everyone eventually stopped inviting you to events. And even talking to you.

It's like crying yourself to sleep every single night because your children got taken.

It‚Äôs like knowing you have one more chance to get better before your child gets adopted and still choosing that bag.

It's like asking others how your own blood child is doing.

It's watching everyone around you succeed and yet you‚Äôre crumbling.

It‚Äôs like everything was on your drug dealer's time. If they said five hours. You‚Äôll wait five hours in a car.

It‚Äôs like stealing everything worth value for dope. No matter how sentimental it was to you, or someone else.

It‚Äôs like losing so much weight you can‚Äôt fit into any of your clothes.

It‚Äôs like losing everything you‚Äôve ever owned in your entire life.

It‚Äôs like nobody believing a word you said, even if it was the truth.

It‚Äôs like being a prisoner inside your own head.

It‚Äôs like contemplating suicide every single day.

It‚Äôs like never being scared to die, because that‚Äôs what you wanted.

It‚Äôs like trying to shut your brain up for even five minutes. It was worth that little time of peace.

It‚Äôs like seeing your family cry for you to stop, only for you to leave and go get high.

Because stopping wasn‚Äôt an option. It wasn‚Äôt possible.

It‚Äôs like you‚Äôd do absolutely anything for more. And you did.

It‚Äôs like everyone hating you no matter where you went, because they knew you were a drug addict.

You'll miss out on your children and they'll be grown before you know it.

You'd kill for your child and do any and everything for them.

Yet you won't be able to get clean for them and we actually turn out to be the ones who hurt them the most.

It‚Äôs like overdosing and going to get high right after.

It‚Äôs like walking into rehab 100 pounds with the clothes on your back and being scared to death.

It‚Äôs like giving your ENTIRE LIFE AWAY. 

So if you‚Äôre ever curious like I was, please at least know the truth.

And I‚Äôm just straight up depressed and feel alone. I know COVID is tough for everyone, no matter what. But being an addict during this is especially tough trying to stay sober and keep motivated. Also I had my counselor who was also the assistant director who was literally one my favorite people, he knew me when I first started the clinic going from literally weighing almost nothing and shooting up in the staircase behind the building to where I am now. He would always remind me of my potential and how far I had come, he was going to help me with getting back into school as well as advocating for me with a few other things. I went in for my appointment with him and the secretary said he no longer worked there. I guess the new director fired him!!

Attempt #1,"I am not really sure why i am writing and what is the point of doing it, but here we go. I am about to end my 20s very soon and damn what a ride it was. Lots of memories most involving alcohol, drugs, gambling, troubles with the law ... i am pretty sure you can imagine the picture and lots of you had similar experiences. Self sabotaging is like a patent of mine i wouldn't even mention what a king of burning bridges and destroying relationships with people who actually cared about me i am. Overall i could definitely say that i feel like i completely wasted my 20s and the worst part is that i can't see myself seeing the end of my 30s if i continue walking that path...

Let me explain the title of my post. It is coming from a saying amongst me and some of my closest friends. The bermunda triangle is having the three major and mostly known addictions: alcohol - drugs - gambling .Having one of the three is bad, but doable. Having 2 out of 3 is fucked up, but still there are chance of getting away of it... however, when you are in the center of the bermuda triangle this mean you have all the three of it. So the saying is, escaping is damn near impossible. I mean it is just talks and jokes between friends, but i just wanted to get some clarification about the title. 

Today was probably the first day i am completely sober for like 2 months i would say(thanks covid).Perhaps the alcohol problem remains my biggest issue, since starting to drink during the day all alone is a common thing for me, while i usually prefer being in a company of friends when abusing drugs or even gambling(at least lately). I am doing mostly cocaine, luckily i never got hooked up on something harder and doing it all by myself is putting me in some hard depression state... overall it is not a pleasant experience for me doing it alone anymore. Mentioning friends, you can already call it... they are not much of a help fighting my addictions, since they are in the same shoes as me.Yeah i know i know, if i want to have a chance ditching my bermuda triangle i have to ditch them first.I know it, they know it too. We are not in our early 20s anymore, where we were doing it all about the partying... often we would get fucked up on cocaine we would browse the streets and figuring out a situation how to stop destroying ourselves with all the shit we keep taking. You can imagine the picture, bunch of cokeheads walking down the street early in the morning after hard night, talking about their miserable existence when the withdrawal starts to hit. 

If i have to be honest life is in front of me. I am independent person away from my family, taking care of myself, having a solid job, with a lot of business plans for my future... that were delayed because of my addictions for it seems like eternity. I  mentioned problems with the law but overall it is not that big of an issue, since it was mostly bar fights(coke+alcohol :/ ) and they are behind me now. I know i can be better person and i know that there is a way out. This is the first time i really believe that i can make the change, that impossible escape out of the bermuda triangle that seems like an utopia for me and my friends. But i can do it, i am a stubborn person and i know i can do it. I just need to find a reason for that change. I have to shut it all off together, because one leads to another and to another, it is all connected. I will either stop it all in the same time or there is no point even trying. No more alcohol, no more cocaine, no more gambling just for the sake of the fun, no more meeting with my friends that i know are the part of the problem... i cannot be responsible for them too. I have to do it all by myself and i know they will understand me and even be happy to see me someday escaping that fucking bermuda triangle. They will understand.

I am excited to try it! Finally i am excited about anything else that doesn't involve booze, drugs or hitting a fucking gambling win. 

I will try to update you about my journey. Tomorrow is day 2 of my sobriety, fucking sound silly i know. If this is the last post you see from me, then you should probably know... that i couldn't make it. But it won't be ;)

Last year (2020) I attempted to change my mindset to distract myself from any and all things drug related. What I found out is that desperation to find or search for something to latch onto and carry my pain (drug-seeking-behavior) ended up transferring to anything else I tried to switch my mindset to, changing my outlook on life ended up having me searching out for some ‚Äúsecret‚Äù or esoteric knowledge as the key to happiness, because,  hell there has to be something more to this life than whatever I currently was experiencing.

This all came about because I recognized that there was a difference between the needs of new age addicts when compared to the needs of the more classic idea of what an addict needs to recover. Long story short (in my opinion), the 12 steps and other comparable programs do well in the area of addressing the past, but those same steps fall short in explaining exactly what we are trying to accomplish by doing said steps. There is also the issue of religion/spirituality considering the fastest growing religion is 'no religion' which includes atheism, theism, and agnostic, young people are adopting these modalities more regularly by the day and they do not mesh with AA. Even worse, it does not lay out a clear path towards finding meaning and fulfillment, it only presents one possible solution, sponsoring others. But success rates of AA are already extremely low, somewhere in the 5% range, so many people find this strategy ineffective and abandon the final step due to the idea that they can't truly help anyone. Through the process of sponsoring others and educating myself in a formal setting, I have developed my own set of steps specifically for people under the age of 35. The reason I posted this though, was to get an idea if this sentiment is shared by the masses. Do you all feel like there is a lack of treatment options, specifically the programs that are widely available such as AA/NA? If I feel enough people also reflect this opinion, then I am going to work towards writing a small book along with my steps, and try to make this available to everyone who wants it for free.

He wants to quit this month because it's destroying his life so im taking two weeks off work and heading over to him to help with while he tries again this time with me there to stop him from using again.

His withdrawal symptoms are too much from him which causes him to go back to using so I want to help those symptoms to keep him clean for the two weeks. He's confident that if he can go two weeks he can keep going. I'm asking people here who may have gone through the same, what did you do to get through the first two weeks and what i can do it help more as well.

I want to take him to NA meetings to meet with others and make relationships with other people who are going through the same because he's a social person and likes meeting people. I think this might help him as well.

How does one balance shame with accountability for their actions in moving forward with their lives? How does one ever truly forgive themselves even after other people have?

Around 5 years ago I almost lost everything because of porn/sexting random people on the internet, which led to infidelity.  My partner and I managed to get through it with counselling and a lot of hard work (we‚Äôve been together for 20 years). 

I genuinely believe I have grown and become a better person and husband in the time that has passed and our relationship is better now, but I am so weighed down by thoughts of 'how could I do that to a person I care about' and ‚ÄòI am a horrible person' that it threatens to overwhelm me sometimes.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I needed consequences and pain to change the course of my life. The problem is, I can‚Äôt seem to process it in any sort of normal way that allows me to live an anxiety free existence.

It sounds self centred but sometimes I just feel like my mistakes are so much worse than my friends and family (that I‚Äôm aware of anyway). It‚Äôs so easy for the shame spiral to take hold and pull me into a deep depression.

I suppose the simple answer to this is 'get over it and move on' but sometimes it just feels impossible. 

When is it ok to be at peace with yourself? I can‚Äôt see any way out of it atm. Nor do I think I deserve it. Can addiction really result in such long term self loathing and does anyone have any stories about managing it.

Sometimes I will think back and everything is kind of a blur, I think I subconsciously block it all out. Plus the fact that I was pretty fucked up daily. But every now and then I will get these glimpses. 
Sometimes I feel so ashamed when I do remember all the messed up things I did just to get high. I even stole from my mother on several occasions knowing that she barely had enough as it was. (& that in itself is just the tip of the very large iceberg) Yet, she didn‚Äôt give up on me & I know in my heart she was my saving grace because I was literally killing myself. There were so many times that I should have died, but I didn‚Äôt. I had given up on myself without even realizing it, but she never did. 
When I went into rehab for the first time I was 104 lbs. - even at 5‚Äô2 that is pretty terrifying (especially because I was always on the thicker side). I do also have an eating disorder, unfortunately, and the drugs did not help. I still thought I was fat and I hated myself for it. I am now 150 lbs and I hate it, everyday is a struggle - but I keep on and I am trying to be healthier and not sacrifice my health simply because I think I‚Äôm not good enough. 
Also when I went into rehab for the first time I had not had my period in over a year. (Not to be gruesome) but it‚Äôs true and as a 18-19 y/o (at the time) female with no other health conditions that is also something terrifying. Like I said, I was literally killing myself. But did it ever bother me? No - the drugs made sure of that. 

I am now healthy - or healthier. Like I said, in May 2021 I will have 2 years clean. I never thought I would be able to say that. I have been to rehab 3 times, but I have had more relapses than I can count. So to anyone who may be getting discouraged or want to give up, please don‚Äôt. It gets better. Reach out and get help. There are resources - take advantage of them. I am one. If you need any help, PLEASE message me. Even if it‚Äôs just someone to talk to, to vent to.

She may be able to buy more and continue abusing without me knowing, but I will end the relationship as soon as I find out she is abusing.

Until recently, I didn‚Äôt view that as an issue. My whole life, I‚Äôve always been drawn to money and the freedom it can give to an individual. At the age of 16, I started a clothing resale business that I ran until a few months ago, giving it all my passion and hard work, eventually raking in a total of $25,000 profit. I recently broke my collarbone in a sports accident, forcing me to stay in my house all day. One day watching YouTube, I got a video recommend to me, showing someone turning $500 to $20,000 in a single night by gambling in online casinos. I thought to myself, ‚Äú this person made (in 5 minutes) everything I made in 2 years.‚Äù Being naturally drawn to freedom within money and the thrill from risk, I was instantly hooked. That night I started with a small $1000 deposit and turned it into $2000. The next night I did the same thing, and within 5 days I managed to turn a profit of over $30,000. However, this initial win, was the driving factor contributing to my downfall. My luck began to fade, and I started loosing- loosing fast. Within 3 days I had lost my whole $30,000 I made. Still chasing looses, trying to make my money back, I lost the remaining $25,000 in a night (within 3 roulette spins). That night was 2 hours ago. I am crushed. Unable to speak. Unable to think. 2 years of hard work- gone in under a week. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I hate that I‚Äôve done this to myself, but I‚Äôm scared to kick the habit. I‚Äôm afraid to kick the habit because I don‚Äôt want to damage my risky personality. As crazy as it sounds, taking calculated risks is what made me so profitable in my clothing business. I‚Äôm scared to tell my parents who admire my business success, unknowing of this detrimental habit. And as of now, due to my broken collarbone, I can barley leave my house or participate in sports. Exercise and sports is what would occupy my mind, preventing me from vicious habits. With this gone, I am confined to my house, forced to sulk in my losses. I‚Äôve never felt a pain and burden quite like this before. I have a little bit of savings money left to spend, and I‚Äôm using every last bit of will power I have to control myself.

Im three months into being clean, but it has been the longest three months of my life. I am finally starting to feel human again and I stumbled across this subreddit just yesterday. 

I cant tell you how much I DO NOT miss the old life, the sensations, the high. I wanted to be numb from the pain and it was so easy to get my hands on it. Thankfully I have had a very devoted group of friends that even when I put them through hell when I was completely high out of my mind and kept going back to it. I don't think I could have ever gotten free from this addiction if it wasn't for them motivating me to make the choices I needed to.  The truth is, I came very close to death multiple times, and have had to come to peace with this fact. The only thing I ever knew to be true during this whole time was that this drug wasn't my identity, but I didn't know how to get out. After all, 36,000 feet doesn't seem so high when you're high. I just wanted more. 

This whole experience has made me so much more aware of the life that I want and the life that I threw away. I look back at the time I spent hooked on these chemicals and I can't help but ask myself, why? WHy did it start? That's where my recovery began. I couldn't begin to recover until I started to answer two questions, and Im still working on the answer to both. The first question is why did it start? Why did I feel like I needed to be numb? What was I so afraid of? Through months of therapy I've thankfully started to identify parts of my past that I had no clue was still hitting me in such a negative way. It was never a big display of unhappiness, but the pain was still there, ever so present and lurking in the places I dared not dig.

The second question is ""Who Am I?"" This is the harder question for me to answer. I mean sure, I could tell people, my name, what I do for a living, where I live, who I associate myself with... But even with all that information, I was no closer to knowing anything about myself. I couldn't look someone in the ye and tell them one thing that truly identifies me out of a world of billions. 7.5 billion people that we know of to be exact. And you, me, are very unique from each and every one of them. It was about 2 months after I white knuckled my way through what seemed like an eternity of sobriety that I realized what defines me as a person is much more about what I'm passionate about. Every one is passionate about something, and its not just one thing we are passionate about. I realized this conglomerate of desires is where we find our identity. I found sobriety hiding in the actions I was never willing to take. See life isn't about, at least for me, those surface level explanations of who we are, but in the glimmer of light that drives us to desire to be better. Not some objective better, but a life driven by what we personally value. I was so focused on being able to tell people I was ""successful."" Success is so subjective to each person though that I drove myself crazy trying to live up to some standard that didn't exist. I was so driven to make everyone happy that I just wanted to shut it all out. I expected life to work like some big algorithm where I could tell people what I did and that would make people want to be me.

I finally see some light at the end of the tunnel, and instead of making time to ""build my empire,"" I've refocused on making time for my passions. Instead of filling my time with idle actions that ultimately didn't amount to much happiness, I've been working on living my life intentionally for my self... In a good way. Surrounding myself with friends and family that push me to be better, and in these experiences is where I find my high. I found out that its better to let the pain come out with my therapist and work through. After all, a little rain is good for growth, and how can someone feel the rain when they're too afraid, and too high, to come down under the clouds again.

Anyway, thanks guys for reading my rant if you've made it this far. I will continue to be apart of this subreddit now and learn from everyone else who shares their stories and experiences. Let's kick addictions together!",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48097327}"

I need to reach out. Thank you to those who take the time to read this. I know its long.,"I cant say why I'm posting this but Ive been thinking about doing so for a while. Long time lurking but never post. I know people here understand the struggle and insanity of addiction and I suppose that's a comforting thought. Im gonna ramble, I suspect it'll be long, and I'm not going to edit it. I hope I don't offend anyone with my views. I'm struggling, stuck, and scared. I dont feel like I'm really living anymore. 

Let me start by saying I know that I've put myself in this situation and I know that no one can save me but me. I know that it has been my consistently careless and irresponsible, selfish choices. Im incapable of living as a functional adult and I truly feel like a slave to my impulses of using. I know I can't use, I know I shouldn't. I know I need to pay off the drug debt I've fronted and get into treatment again. The authentic part of me yearns to get on a positive path of passion and selflessness again. Another part of me will decide in a whim that I'm fronting more and then, I'm out of control. One too many 1000 never enough of course... I have been carelessly abusing for over a year now and just in the last month have I finally started coming out to my ma and close friends about how bad of a closet user I really am. This is the worst place I've been in. Though I can't bear to share with them how much I actually owe atm (its about 2700). I stopped paying bills this month and my internet has been cut off. Next comes utilities and my phone i suspect.. I also have a payday loan overdue of about 500 that has already bounced once and is gonna start collecting interest. Ive been sharing the place I currently live at with my ma. She doesn't live here but pays half rent to keep her stuff here. This month she has now had to pay full rent and is currently staying with me to try and help me stop using. I've still used behind her back and I hate myself for that. She thinks I've been clean a week but I was clean for four days (because we left town) and when we came back I started fronting more and have been using/lying since. Im well aware she is enabling me in some ways and I hate that too. She doesn't understand the addict mentality but tries her best to support me even though she doesn't know how. She doesn't deserve this. All she does is love me... I feel like I took her away from living with her spouse to help me and I know she'd rather be staying there.. On top of those things, I have a 500 dollar ticket I gotta pay to the court by the end of March or I get a few days jail time. I feel so stuck. I recognize the mind's thoughts saying 'once you pay off the drug debt you can go into treatment.' But I've been saying that to myself for months and this is the most I've ever racked up. Pbviously I have a good relationship with dealer and thats why im able to front so much..¬† but I know its gonna get me into trouble sooner or later and I'm scared that time is coming now. I feel so many things and I am ashamed of the person this addiction makes me and has made me. I have been to treatment twice in the past. Ive started talking to an addiction counselor and getting an application ready to get into another treatment program. I've done the medical with a doc. Im finally ready to go again but I feel trapped in the sense I have to pay these dealers first.. I mean, they know where I live n stuff. I've been defeated for a while and I'm sick of living in my own will. Its fucked me. I do not know whats best for me. I'm tired. You all know what that tiredness is like. I know I need help because I want to stop and I need to before I get myself killed, but I can't. This is the worst hole I've ever dug myself and now I'm just scared I won't make it back into recovery. I know that I need the recovery bubble of a safe place to create some solid foundation. I mean, its the only thing thats ever worked for me when I get to this place I'm in. I can't stop using but I know I need to. A few years ago, I left the halfway house I was in after treatment the second time and nine months of sobriety to move back to a diff city with the girl I had been seeing for several years (she's the blessing that got me into treatment the first time). We were doing long distance while I was in treatment. However she only planted the seeds that enabled me to look at myself and realize/admit for the first time that I actually had a problem. I want to clarify that I've never went to treatment for anyone but myself. Both times I went were for me and god knows I gave it my all. When im in there, I reconnect with my spirituality and beingness and have always done so much work on myself and lived so beautifully. I've truly been blessed to witness God's will (my higher power, call it what you will) act in my life and lead it into places I could only sit in moments of amazement and gratitude, speechless, trying to comprehend how I even deserved so much grace. I know its been God's will when I surrendered and lived in sobriety. I sort of think about it like this,¬† if God himself allowed me to write down how I wanted my life to go, it would never have even touched the grace and goodness that actually came into fruition for me during those times.. I just want to be authentic again. I get so overwhelmed lately with everything thats been crashing down around me and fronting so much that I feel like I might actually get hurt from being unable to pay fast enough. I guess this is kind of a brain dump of a post and I realize it's quite a long ramble that may seem scattered and all over the place.. Its where im at. For anyone that got this far, thank you for taking the time to read a fellow addict's struggle. Happy New Year to those living in sobriety. Its because of communities like this that I know im not alone in this insanity that I've entertained for so, so long. I know and trust it will all work out and I know all these feelings and thoughts will come and go, as they always do. Im just really struggling with where I've put myself today and Ive lost ambition or drive to do anything in these last several months. I've been continually choosing drugs over a spiritual path that yearns for me since my spiritual path even began. I've experienced a lot of profound things within myself through introspection and meditation etc. It breaks my heart I've put myself here. I'm like, the drug addict lost cause of my family. Thats how I feel. Anyways, I write a lot of poetry and feel inspired for no reason at all to end this (for real this time) with something I've written in the past. Take what you will from the post and my views. Of course they are mine only and its okay if my spiritual talk is a little odd for some people. Im pretty commonly known for having unpopular opinions, if you want to call them that. After all, my higher power is my own and I have nothing to prove. All in all, I'm seriously just struggling... and im scared about the future considering the situation I've placed myself in. I just pray im meant to get into treatment a third time and when I do, I'll never let my recovery go again. Not for anything or anyone. I suppose I needed this last year of abuse to come to that place within myself.¬† Thats a blessing I can take from this dark place. I just dont know but I pray im meant to pay this debt off and get into a place where im safe from my own self. I cant even trust myself to be alone anymore... thanks for listening.

I on the other hand have not grown up/been used to this and certainly don‚Äôt have such issues myself. When he drinks it‚Äôs always spirits and he drinks every single day. He will drink when he first wakes up if it‚Äôs available and any time I‚Äôm out - work, walking the dog, any opportunity - will be drunk when I come back. When he is on alcohol in particular, he is vile. He has never ever physically abused me however I‚Äôm sure that the verbal and emotional venom levelled at me are nothing short of abusive. This has really made me think, as I would never class myself as being in an ‚Äòabusive relationship‚Äô.. 

We are both professional very skilled people and so i think many think we have it made and would never guess what I see. He isnt like this in front of others, only me. He is sunshine and the life and soul of the party, it is only when the door closes and it‚Äôs just him and i that the nastiness is unleashed. He looks at me like he actually hates me, and will start and argument for no reason. He does what I think (from research) appears to be gaslighting and tactics like that. He will say something and then immediately after deny he said it, and often call me a liar in the process. I am often left bewildered, extremely upset and in some cases a bit scared, although not really sure what Of as he has NEVER hit me. My anxiety is off the wall and I never leave any prescription meds in the house when I‚Äôm not there, as I fear if he knew or saw them he would take them. I have no evidence to suggest this has happened, however, I have seen how he behaves if he thinks I have any - he rages if I don‚Äôt give in to him (I never have done, perhaps why he hates me so much) and will often yell that I‚Äôm selfish and ‚Äògreedy‚Äô if I dare to take my own meds when I need them. 

Interestingly this wasn‚Äôt the version of him I met, I think it has got worse due to life events but I also think he has hidden this issue well over the years. I do not have much family and this also works against me. He lies and manipulates his own family who think their son can do no wrong. 

I don‚Äôt know what i did to deserve all this or where I ended up being treated like this. 

Can anyone relate or offer advice? im trying to make plans to get out but it‚Äôs not easy with little money and family support behind me, however I WILL do it. 

Does anyone have any advice with how to cope in the mean time? i have long stopped yelling back in arguments, and I now just simply walk away to another room in the house or go out. As the title says, it‚Äôs like living with two diff people - the sober one is the kind, warm hearted smart guy I fell for. The addict in him is abusive, manipulative, lies, gaslights, is unpredictable and can be horrible to live with. I feel more and more like it‚Äôs me, that I‚Äôm the problem, but I don‚Äôt have this kind of issue with anyone else in my life - even bosses, exes etc, no one. 

It‚Äôs my first time posting here so sorry if I‚Äôve not done it right. Just need some advice of people who can relate I guess..

(Trigger warning) Mainly cutting but god, I will do just about anything as long as it hurts cause then it feels good, contrary to popular belief (for whatever reason - it's kinda logical)

Anyway, I've been clean for a week, starting today, and began the official cleansing process about 3 or 4 weeks ago (recovery starts before you begin going clean) and I already feel so fucking miserable.

I know that it's beneficial in the long run. When I had to be hospitalized, I realized just how tired my body was, and it feels so much better than being a walking corpse. I can feel shit again and it feels like I'm free.

But I can barely sleep. My anxiety is so bad that some days I struggle to physically open my mouth to talk to people. I get random panic attacks and starting thinking about traumatic things I've experienced. My depression has spiked. I'm hallucinating more frequently. It feels like I've taken 100 steps backwards, when that's clearly not true because my addiction was genuinely killing me, even if it made me feel better.

My brain just feels like a fucking keysmash. Lots of the letter g, r and m. I have so much on my mind and yet I am so dysfunctional right now I cannot express any of it quite yet.

Really I just wanna sleep. It's 4 am. I've been up since midnight. I already slept for like 3 hours but I used to sleep like a fucking baby (8-12 hrs) so it really does not feel good (even tho all that sleep went to repairing tissue so I was very much not getting enough energy anyway ahaha)

Replacing the core of your brain's motivation with something else is literally impossible to want to do, in the sense that motivation will always fight to not be undermined.

It doesn't have to be any one thing that you surrender to.
But the point is to sacrifice your wants to it and let it heal you.

There will be multiple hard truths you'll just have to accept, not everyone will be happy that you're getting sober, you'll lose a lot of people most of them will be fake friends. However, a few will cheer you on and wish they could stop themselves but anyone who gives any negative reaction to your sobriety get that person out of your life. This is a viewer question will not disclose their name but, if you don't want to watch you'll miss a lot of key points but, you'll want to stay with a family member or sober friend, also get yourself into a program even if you don't want suboxone or methadone or vivitrol but counseling is really important the truth is most of us do drugs because we aren't happy with either who we are in life or where are life has taken us, not to mention we don't naturally create dopamine, so don't be afraid to use a crutch at first don't let people tell you that's not being sober. If you can do it by yourself then, that's even better. However, sometimes its just not that simple, so keep your options open.

2021-01-01 08:19:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/kob62k/not_talking_to_family/,Not talking to family.,"In the past two to three years, my (46M) two younger brothers (43M and 38M) have become addicted to prescription painkillers. One has been arrested once for possession, OD‚Äôd and spent a few days in the hospital, and the other one has been arrested a few times for possession/intent to distribute, credit card fraud, and shop lifting. I didn‚Äôt know anything about this for a long time, but I got suspicious when they started borrowing money from me and then there were often reasons why they couldn‚Äôt pay me back. They live together, so God only knows what goes on between them and how I may have gotten played. Based on some things they said, I wound up doing some research online and it took me all of 15 minutes to see arrest records and other things. I decided to speak with them about it and not judge, but to offer my help in getting clean. They‚Äôve both lost joint custody of their sons until they get clean, so they need to get their act together. However, I was met with hostility and anger, and they will no longer speak to me. I teach a course called ‚ÄúCrucial Conversations,‚Äù so please trust me when I say that the way I handled the conversation was appropriate. 

That said, that hasn‚Äôt stopped them from sending me a couple of texts this year asking for money because they can‚Äôt keep a job. They sent these long sob stories about how it was needed for their sons, which I know is crap because they can‚Äôt even be with them. Plus, that is typical addict behavior: every ask for money is a story to try and make you feel sorry for them. I‚Äôve met these asks only with, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help you until you‚Äôre willing to admit you have a problem and we can then get you the help you need. I love you.‚Äù  I‚Äôm then met with something like, ‚ÄúFuck you! I‚Äôm not a drug addict! You just think you‚Äôre better than me.‚Äù Blah blah blah. 

In conversations with my aunts and uncles, I have learned that this past year alone that my mom and step-dad have given them over $20,000!!!! Whenever my brothers ask them for rent money, money for gas, etc. they give it to them because they know that if they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll lose contact the way I have. So, my mom is an enabler, she has admitted to me that she‚Äôs fully aware that she‚Äôs an enabler, but she won‚Äôt cut them off like she should because they are using her love for them as blackmail. Because if this, my mom is always broke and has asked me for money every now and then and pays me back as soon as she gets paid. However, I had a come to Jesus moment with her because I told her I knew about all the arrests and that I was super hurt that she didn‚Äôt tell me, especially when she probably knew they were going to try to take advantage of me. I also told her I knew about all of the money she‚Äôs given to my brothers, so her requests to borrow money from me have stopped. 

So now this has led to another problem. My mom is now too broke to be a decent grandmother to my son. He is an up and coming Formula 4 racecar driver and had a test race just over an hour away from where she lives, which is super rare and maybe the only chance they‚Äôll have in awhile or ever to see him race live, but the day before, she ‚Äúgot sick‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt come. I would later do a little digging and found out that it was a financial issue. She had spent all of her money buying Christmas presents for my nephews and couldn‚Äôt even afford gas to drive an hour away and back. Also, she didn‚Äôt send my son a Christmas gift this year; $10 in a card would have been just fine. Hell, just a card would have said she at least cared. It just sucks that he knows that his cousins are getting lots of presents from his grandmother but he didn‚Äôt even get a Christmas card. It‚Äôs not a materialistic thing, just a thoughtful thing.  

So now, I‚Äôm considering giving my mom an ultimatum that will go something like, ‚ÄúUntil you stop enabling them, I can‚Äôt be a part of this whole toxic roller coaster you‚Äôre on. When you‚Äôre ready to be a part of my family‚Äôs life again, let me know.‚Äù Or is that the opposite of what she needs right now? I just don‚Äôt think I should have to be the parent to my whole family, especially when they seem to resent me because I‚Äôm the only one who didn‚Äôt drop out of college and am financially independent. 

Any advice on how to approach all of them is completely appreciated. I‚Äôm so lost and heartbroken because just a few years ago, we were a really close family. My uncle died of COVID in September and they didn‚Äôt even come to the small outdoor service we had.

During court, I was rock-bottom low and picked up a habit. When all was done I spent about another 2 years battling an on and off addiction. 

Later I found a counsellor and got to the root of the addiction. Much the same as most addictions, I hated myself and did what I needed to escape at the time. Anyway, the final session before I kicked it, she asked me whats the most important thing in life. 
I said happiness and she shot me down real quick. She explained why she disagreed and told me to write a page about what I took from the session. Coincidentally my good mate, and wise man in the exert below, said something similar to me at a friends funeral a week prior.

Anyway, today I found the page amongst the court docs and it pretty much kicked me in the nuts. 

Not sure anyone really needs to read this, but it changed my life so I'm gonna share it. Of course it isn't the secret to ending addiction, but for me it was the beginning of acceptance, accountability and a change of mindset.

Strange looking back and seeing what mattered then and what matters now...

.

""Seeking perpetual happiness and positivity is certain failure. It is a state of mind, not a character trait. It's impossible, so don't put that kind of pressure on yourself.

Today, I'm ok, but I know there's plenty of shit days ahead for myself and everyone around me. I think to truely care, long term, for yourself and those around you, you have to be rational, looking through a polar lens - positively, negatively, circumstantially. It is both cruel to be kind, and kind to be cruel. Hopefully optimistic, cautiously pessimistic. Play the hand your dealt.

Honestly, I try to look for happiness and in general, I try to look at things positively, but it's most important to keep your rational outlook cause life ain't sunshine and rainbows. 
A wise man once told me, ""Life is cruelty with moments of bliss in between. It's not about happiness, it's about living a meaningful existence"". 

So stop seeking sunshine and rainbows, get out of your mind and into your life. You are enough Josh, now clean your fucking shit up."" - 2015",108,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49058944}"

This NYE my partner and I had a drink with our neighbours/friends, who are husband and wife. The husband drank quite a bit, and eventually he started to openen up about an addiction he has to gambling. He has lost a lot of money; although thankfully so far not enough to ruin his family, he has lost enough to set him a couple of years back from buying a house and being debt-free. His wife was clearly uncomfortable saying she had to tend to the dog, and eventually left, he stayed and kept talking. Maybe I should have encouraged him to leave so his wife wasn't embarassed, but I didn't say anything to make him leave or stay, nor did my husband. he talked about having a little voice in his head, saying that he just goes crazy etc and that it's like he's posessed. 

he says that once he loses 1 penny, he keeps playing to try and get the money back. It was really sad.

After a while of just listening, I felt it fair to ""balance things out"", so to speak, and told him about my issues (I was ""addicted to food"" as I suffered with Bulimia for 10 years and have been purge-free since july 2020) and how I can empathise with feeling out of control of my own body and actions. 

I don't know if i did the wrong thing, but I tried to explain what helped for me, the process and the hard rules I set for myself (I can never eat chips or crisps again, unless I made them myself from scratch without using oil. they are a major trigger and once I start I can't stop eating).

 I basically said  he is in control of the hands that reach for the wallet, that pull out that first coin. I said that voice can't make him do those things unless he allows it, and that I treat that voice as a separate part of me: the part that wants my destruction. I treat it as a manipulator I can dominate (the never binge again method by dr Livingston. It might not be for everyone but it works for me).

I then said that the best thing is to never even put that first coin, that the moment he bets the first penny he has already lost against the voice, so he should try to never start. I then said I believe in him and that I know he can overcome this. I mentioned looking for some of the resources that helped me. He then went home.

I am not sure I did or said the right things, and now wonder how to behave towards him now.

It's upsetting to think maybe I went about this the wrong way. maybe I should have just listened without saying anything? Is it good or bad that I shared my own issues, and what helped me? 

Do I pretend he never said anything, unless he mentions it again?

&#x200B;

I must add he is the type of person that if you say ""have you tried therapy"" he'll just get upset/offended/scoff as his culture/mindset isn't very progressive with mental health

I never did.
Well I was saved again about an hour ago, I came to with paramedics around me and I was on the bathroom floor and had a tube in my throat, and all these wires on my chest. I thought everything was going to be okay when I chose to lapse again today. My denial overtook me, obsession and compulsion. This feels so painful and traumatic, everyone involved doesnt deserve this. 

 I'm supposed to experience 2021 I suppose. Happy new year. Thank you Simon and Mike for saving my life. And whoever initially found me. I'm scared and terrified of the next one. What the fuck, I just dont understand any of this.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7553153}"
