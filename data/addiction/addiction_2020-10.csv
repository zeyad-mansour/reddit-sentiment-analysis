1. Life without dependencies seems impossible. You go back to them however the guilt you get after the act. It seems like an endless infinite loop which can not be broken.

2. Even when you get day/s passed righteously, you feel burdened and restless to go back to dependencies. 

3. Regular days seems no fun and the only way to get fun out of life seems to be by failing yourself to go back to dependencies. 

4. Going to dependencies seems super easy, cheap, a natural option with every chance, space, crisis. Rather you are looking for any excuse to go for it. 


5. Mere idea of Quitting bad habits seems impossible. 


6. When you can't get to get back to your dependencies, you tend to get restless, aggressive or even violent. 


7. You cant get past these habits all days long, all months and years, decades long. 



When you get these feelings, decide to change and log it. Follow up everyday. Find fun in life. Pursue hobbies. Define fun in many ways. Plan the funs tmevery day, every week, every month. 


Wishing all great success!!!",3,0

Well we started off really rocky, mom developed a drinking problem that got worse and worse as we went on. Any time any of her friends or me told her we could start seeing a problem developing she would just brush us off and say"" well I'm allowed to have a drink after a long days work"" but it never was "" A "" drink. It was always almost a whole bottle. Well eventually her drinking slowed down but one night about a week ago, me and my sisters and my daughter all got loaded into the car to help mom with her work one evening. Well she stops to get a liquor bottle while were out and about driving, naturally I don't support that decision but she says ""It's fine I have it under control"". Well the night goes on and she tells me she has also taken half a Xanax, we started arguing about something, so I just shut my mouth and kept quiet while I was on my phone while she was talking to me. We almost got into a accident and I look up from my phone in terror cause we have all of our babies with us and my mother says "" Yeah that's what I thought, wake the fuck up""....almost like she had planned this shit. The night goes on she ends up slapping me in my face and hitting my arm... by the end of that night i was already making plan to move cause I knew that our relationship was to toxic for both of us to continue living together. So I devise a plan, and tell my mom a week later "" Listen I don't think we should live together anymore because we have both grown increasingly toxic towards each other"" she comes back with "" I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING THIS RIGHT NOW, I JUST GOT A BRAND NEW JOB, AND YOU WANNA BAIL ON ME?! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR BEING THIS SELFISH, 90% OF THE TIME WE ARE A PERFECTLY FUNCTIONING FAMILY""..... like okay... but what about that 10%? I should just brush off the fact that we got physical the other night? … the night gets worse when she starts drinking... then even worse again when she decided to start taking Xanax  … I have video proof and voice recordings of her acting ABSOLUTELY PSYCHOTIC.... VIDEOS OF HER SHOVING MY DAUGHTER ACROSS THE ROOM AND YELLING AT HER TO GET THE FUCK OUT. She ended up calling the cops and I had every decision to send her to jail that night but my sisters would've had nowhere to go. The cops leave and we are supposed to stay separated until my ride gets there and she comes in and starts beating my ass, I have scratches all over me, bumps on my head from her bashing my head over and over, and bruises all over my body... What do I do from here? I have already left but I am DEATHLY AFRAID for my little sisters... I don't even have all of my stuff and I definitely do not want to be around her at all.

10,2020-10-30 09:41:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jkwyk2/adderall_is_going_to_be_the_literal_death_of_me/,Adderall is going to be the literal death of me.,"You know, I have made a lot of posts here on Reddit. And in my two and a half years of being an active user with over 900 posts on my account, I genuinely believe this is the most important/crucial one I have ever written.

Let me preface by saying: I do NOT have ADHD, hence why I believe Adderall affects me the way I am about to explain in this bible-lengthed post does. I am currently 20 years old, a junior in college, and am one of if not THE most irresponsible user of Adderall I know (I guess you could label me as an abuser of it).

Having literally just become aware of how much this drug is actually fucking up my life (of which is technically my own fault to begin with) after literally just receiving an email from one of absolute humblest/kindest professors I have ever had in my college career thus far, who stated with a rather angrily upset/disappointed tone that I have missed three classes so far, and that if I miss anymore, my letter grade will drop by a half for each day I do not attend. Now, I know this might just seem like an email he sent as a result of looking out for me, but on a personal level, it was a damn wake-up call. Allow me to explain...

Holy fuck, actually. I don’t even know where to start!

Alright, first of all, I wish I did not love Adderall as much as I do, and I especially wish I listened to all the warnings people gave me over the years when they said I was on some pretty fucking thin ice on all of my “Adderall appreciation posts” that I’ve made in the past. I don’t know what it is with this drug... no, I mean like, I LITERALLY don’t know what to make of it! It’s so fucking beautiful and appealing, yet ironically it has the capability of putting you between a rock and a hard dick. Perhaps it is a demon disguised as an angel to lure you into its grasp to the point in which you can no longer function without it constantly (if not always) holding your hand.

I am just going to put the reality of which Adderall has completely blinded me from in a nutshell for you:

I have not touched, hell, even thought about any of my school assignments in over a week (and my agenda is loaded), I have not slept for more than 4, MAYBE 5 hours in over a week, and whenever I do manage to sleep and avoid taking any pills, it’s usually for 24 hours straight. Thus, I have missed about seven or eight classes in total now (not just the one the professor who sent me that email I mentioned above teaches; I mean all the classes on my damn schedule). I have barely eaten anything and am \~25 pounds lighter than what I should be, I got two parking tickets because I was too lazy to park my car in the fucking garage that I PAY FOR... LESS THAN LITERALLY ONE BLOCK AWAY MIGHT I ADD... I have been getting so much shit done lately (all of which will probably benefit me and my life by a factor of about 1⁄100, yet somehow Adderall makes it feel like those things actually hold some sort of significance), I have compulsively spent more money than I can admit and have been draining the fuck out of my bank account (of which is actually going to be in the ER soon), and I have isolated myself in the outside world because I have all the dopamine I need right here at home in a bunch of cursed, orange pills.

(That isn’t even everything, by the way. If I listed all of it, the previous paragraph would have been nearly twice as long.)

So, in summary, **my life is crumbling around me while I am in la la land.** That’s my situation in a fucking sentence. You want a TL;DR? There it is.

I have approached my excessive Adderall intake in no other way than the following: make excuses, find unreasonable purposes for popping another pill, and most commonly of all… deny, deny, deny. I′m sorry, but what in the name of Jesus Saint McFuck has gotten into my immature, lazy, fried ass brain to have come to this? (Oh wait, that′s right–it’s Adderall! Silly me, that was an easy one!)

With all that being said, I guess you could officially consider my furniture dusted, because I am in WAY too deep with this drug that DISTRACTS me from schoolwork (among other priorities), responsibilities, self-care (among many other things), and if there is an exit, believe when I say, I know it′s far… VERY far out of sight by now.

P.S. And you know what? Fuck you too, depression... maybe if you didn’t eat me alive every day, I wouldn’t be so compelled to take at least three times the amount of this shit that I ACTUALLY need.

And with that, I appreciate it if you made it this far, and I truly hope you do not ever find yourself in the same situation as me because you matter, you are loved, and you deserve way better than any of this.

Have a good day...",15,0

Honestly in the past when I tried to quit I didn't have the conviction that i do now so I'm finding it to be not so bad. However I do have a question. Is it normal to sleep heavier then I used to before I quit? I'm having a bit of trouble of waking up for work since I have started. So I'm just wondering if this is a withdrawal symptom or am I just being crazy? I'm just confused because one would think it would be easier to wake up without alcohol in my system as opposed to 7 to 10 shots of rum in my system. I'm just very confused and need some reassurance.,3,0
14,2020-10-29 22:06:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jko3z8/so_i_realize_something_recently/,So I realize something recently,"So I finally decided to myself that enough is enough with my addiction and I decided to finally call it quits, I am abstaining finally from weed and LSD. those two things on their own aren't that bad and they can't be really nice under the right circumstances for people, but, not for me. Now that I'm starting to taper off of weed especially I'm starting to realize a lot of the stuff I thought was normal and okay back when I was using wasn't really the most healthy thing for me mentally.

One of my reasons of using frequently prior to May of this year was I was trying to hide from who I was and what I did back when I was on undiagnosed and on the wrong medicine as a bipolar undercover and in doing so I was having to deal with events that happened well over two years ago when I was a different person entirely. So when I stop smoking weed I had to start dealing with my own problems myself and now with the help of others and it was hard especially when I used acid and it made me realize how damaged I was.

I was stuck in the past for so long so much so that I didn't realize how much effort was putting into my mental health and how far I've come over the years. I didn't matter to me how good of a person I was now, I still thought I was the monster I was back in 2018 and before.

On top of that my sobriety has been showing me that I heavily relied on best friend Mary for so long and even though I had quite a few bad trips due to my mental health being not as good as it should have been I still kept going because I'd rather risk having a bad time on weed than being reminded of all the people I've hurt throughout the years

After a while it just becomes a never-ending cycle of misery and the only way I saw out of it was to finally say f*** it I'm done I want to be the wife my husband thinks I am, I want to be the employee my boss loves, I want to be the mom I wish I had growing upand that's my motivation for what I'm doing now. I'm sorry this is long I just wanted to get it out. This community is wonderful even though I don't know anything about you guys I know one thing that we both have in common. We all want the best for ourselves and sometimes that's all we need to start in the right direction.",4,0

He left an hour ago (around midnight our time) swearing he was just going to a guy friends house he his helping with his business and would come back soon... but I could sense his tension and struggle about leaving... why would he have to leave to do that at this hour on a Thursday night?

What can I say that would make him want to come home? He says when I try to get him to come home it pushes him away further... or that he is afraid to come home because he doesn’t want to feel judged... at this point I am so worried about him, I am willing to try anything. 

I believe he wants to stop, but he is struggling with the constant urge.

A 7 day detox bed is available for me in 4 days.How bad will this be, and WHAT TO DO while playing the waiting game? ANY words of encouragement would be AWFULLY appreciated right now.","Hi all.

First time posting in a long time, but all of your words have been extremely helpful in observation reading. I've been using Klonopin 2mg for 3 years, with increased xanax use (street) for the last 6 months. All in all I would approximate my usage to be 5-6mg daily on average. Last week I finally told my addiction specialist about my increased use and what to do. She suggested a 7 day detox close to where I live. She cancelled the 2mg Klonopin script and replaced it with 14 days (7 days remaining) of 30mg Diazepam. For the last 3 days or so, I've only taken 3-4 mg Xanax+The 30mg Diazepam. As of today, and for the next 3 days I've cut out the Xanax and am just taking the 30mg Diazepam prescribed. 

Waiting for the 7 day detox, starting in 4 days is killing me. I hate the waiting and part of me (all of us) thinks I can handle a self taper on my own; but I KNOW that detox tends to take you by the shoulders, shake your body and say WAKE UP -this is where you are in life. 

How do you guys reckon it will be? I've done 30 days in Rehab 5 years ago and it helped a great deal, but life happened again, and without the proper coping skills and understanding, I'm back here. 

It's a weird TL;DR but - What have you guys and gals done in the interim of waiting for a big scary detox? I've got work off, so currently I'm planning to just putter around being gentle with myself - smoking some weed and watching some movies to stay distracted. I hate hate hate hate this. But i've made my choices, i've made my bed, and now I must lie in it.",2,0

2. Describe some barriers/challenges people with addiction may face when trying to access medical care (personal experience is helpful as well).

Physiopatic manipulation I believe its called. A lot of the times I really dont know what I feel. Feelings where never taught to be delt with. I was told what to think not how to think. I started to be defiant and form an authority complex. Narcissistic tendencies blaming others but playing like I blamed myself for people's ignorance. I drank exclusively because I never learned how to respond to constructive criticism or even compliments. I never gave a fuck about no one. Nott even myself. I never valued my freedom or life. I ended up in jail with a 4 year sentence. Jail taught me solitude but also taught me loneliness. I was trapped in a cage for years of my life. No control over what I did above the jail issued sheets. Prison gave me a little stability for once in my life. Always moving or changing schools as a kid. I learned to adapt and put on a persona to blend. At this point I just wanted to be unnoticed. The more I tried to fit in the more eyes turned to me. Drugs made me careless. Made me forget the value of freedom and how precious a human life is. My ignorance was actually just arrogance I knew what I was doing. As long as the attentioni is on someone else I dont even care. You live like that you start doing alot of horrible things not caring or thing.about the consequences. You start believing you are that monster. You're stuck in that cycle till you decide. This is a personal battle though within your mind. You are broken now. Nothing but sadness and ambiguous anxiety. The half full cup that's empty. Might as drop a 2 gram shard in that cup and mix it with some Henny,3,0

It’s been 12 years since I’ve seen you, 12 years since I’ve needed you, 12 years since I turned my back on you and walked away.  So why after 12 years did you have to come back into my life.  I was so happy without you, I was making it on my own.  I have made a lot of changes since I last saw you, I have my own place, a nice car and until the pandemic a nice job.  

Now only 2 months back together and I am depressed, angry, sad, disgusted, paranoid, unable to get a job and spending money I desperately need... all for you.  How did I let this happen, how am I going to tell my family you are back in my life, just one little stumble and there you were, happy to see me, excited to be back together.  

I hate you!!! I want you gone, you ruined my life before, I know what you are capable of, I know what you can take away from me, I know all about you.

I'm starting to notice that some people are also getting addicted to this bitch of a substance, in this post I will talk about how I got addicted and what I'm trying to do to end this addiction cycle.

The first time I tried ecstacy in my life I really didn't know what to expect, at that timeI've tried psychedelics before but this was different, my first was a 200 mg pill, my stupidity at that time allowed me to take all the pill without asking the dealer if I should split it or not... After about 40 minute or ingestion I was in absolute pure bliss, never in a million lives would I ever guessed that there is such a state that exists, I mean you know the rest of the story, it's fucking MDMA....

I fell in love with this drug, but I was well aware of its dangers and how often I could take it, I never took it more than once every two to three months, but I hated that, yet I was willing to wait and not loose that magical feeling.

Eventually I got the chance to use 3mmc, which had a warning by the dealer that is has addiction potential due to low tolorance, at that time I never experienced addiction other than a bit of craving for weed, but that wasn't so bad.

3mmc when taken orally gave me a mild MDMA high, less heavy on the body and pretty euphoric, a bit similar to speed, it makes you happy, cheerful, friendly as fuck,you just wanna talk with fucking everyone on social media and like their posts for no reason,  it can also make you a horny beast who can last 7 hours masturbating.

I was taking it orally, about once every 2 to 3 weeks, I had no cravings or anything to take it, but I loved the drug very much, and was willing to experiment further with it, the day I decided to snort the substance was probably a turning point, now my brain knew  how can it release dopamine and serotonin the easiest, and it will trick me to go buy some even if it means getting broke, fucking your health, money and relationship.

Now I'm using 1 to 1.5 grams a week, once a week, and I never broke that pattern, although I'm still in the danger of increasing my use, it's actually a good thing I'm pretty broke now because of it, as it's not that cheap where i live (130$ for a g).

Now I can't break out of this cycle , it's been going on for more than 8 month, I get cravings on once a week, but once I get the craving for lines binge, I will find a fucking way to get it, even if it meant borrowing money from friends and lying to them.

I need your help, I don't know if deep inside me I really want to quit cuz I might be using this post just to pretend I'm doing something about it. A comment here or personal message is very appreciated, I cannot go to rehab yet as I live with a religious family, and if they know about any of this I'm fucked... 


What the drug taught me about addiction:

-The more I used, the more familiar I got with the feeling and the harder it got to fight the craving.

-The drug will take priority over almost everything, I think about it often.

-Snorting stimulants is fucking addicting.
 And other shit..


Some effects I have now after long use:

1- cognitive abilities are pretty good, but i was much sharper before.

2- my sleep quality is pretty shit, waking up in the morning feels like hell.

3- My memory is OK, but i do get a bit clumsy a day or two after use.

4-I get triggers from seeing anything related to drug ritual, just seeing credit card can remind of the drug.

That's what I can think of for now..
 Sorry for the long post but I wanted to share and I'm pretty desperate for help at this point, and help spread awarenesses of the potential dangers of this rc.

Thank you ❤️",1,0

My grandpa was a serious alcoholic who died young because of his drinking so I have that genetic predisposition. I've already found it super easy to get addicted to things (not drugs), but I don't think they can affect my life the way alcohol will. 

I've tried weed and alcohol before, but whatever strain of weed I had fucked up my skin so I'm not gonna try that again for a while. For alcohol though, it really helps me feel not so sad during those bad moments. The second time I drank, I just kept drinking until I couldn't feel anything anymore, threw up, drank a liter of water, went to bed, and woke up in the morning feeling like a new, happy person. 

I'm worried that I'm going to chase that feeling if I ever start drinking again, but I also know drinking is a part of college culture. I know I sound like I really don't want to drink, but there's also a part of me that thinks that a lot of people drink during college without getting addicted, why shouldn't I?

It’s like there’s a direct emotional link to the end goal of being fully recovered and healthy but there’s a cognitive disconnect somewhere where that straight line to the goal ignores the process. The process and rewiring my habits/lifestyle, mindset etc is what doesn’t feel like it has weight to it.

I’m guessing this is the biggest problem with any addict. I want to be better more than anything on earth but the work is where I run into motivation issues because I know this will take years of being wholly committed to this work and abstinence of this compulsive, instant reward seeking behavior.

It just feels like on the day to day the process is too abstract from the end prize to want to follow immediately. What I want to do immediately is give in to my vices.",4,0

Thanks for taking the time to read my woes.

I've always been a fan of drugs, mostly dabbled in E and coke when younger. Would be all for some coke on an odd night out etc, but never frequently, with years between sometimes.

A few years ago I moved back close to my hometown, and started getting from a family member. Slowly but surely I started to run up higher and higher monthly bills. Have a decent job, so was never an issue. Well, paying it that is. The amount I spent/spend causes me to loathe myself. Especially since I've a wife and 5 kids. 

I think for a long time, until just recently, I convinced myself that since I don't crave it, or think about it every day, or get intense cravings etc that I wasn't addicted. What I do though, is I can never refuse the offer, or stop myself from asking for more if I see one of the many people that I'm ""friends""(customer) with. Or, I'll have one slight fucken inconvenience, or negative thing happen and then convince myself that's a reason to go get.

It got really bad last year, but after coming clean to the wife and talking about it, I got a lot better. Still occasional use, but night and day compared to what I was.

However, last couple of months I can feel myself slipping. The usual pattern is I'll maybe get some, and then all bets are off - end up polishing off a gate in a day or two myself. Sitting downstairs not even fucking enjoying myself.

It got really bad when I would use kik etc to chat on sexting groups etc, doing all sorts of shit that just made me think of how even chatting like I was is betrayal, never mind all the pics and vids i sent. Shameful behaviour that was just fucken pointless and empty ""good feels"".

I spoke to the wife just the other day, about how I can feel myself slipping again. And we thought of some actions we can do to help, like her coming with me when I go pick up weed etc, since all my mates are now selling, especially with telegram etc posting ounces of flake to their door. Took her today, she waited in car and I ended up getting a g of flake. Working from home wired as fuck. 

Never mind the abbsolute state of my nose. Already had a deviated septum and got operated on when I was early teen(not drug related just mutant jankyy nose), so I dread to think what its like. Had the chunks of lining blowing out etc. It terrifies me, and I can't work up courage to even go to docs. 

Don't even know why I'm posting tbh, I think I am beyond help. I keep saying I don;t want to completely stop, I just want to be able to go back to the once in a blue moon days. But I honestly don't think that's even possible at this point. Reason Im slipping is because wife and I went away for weekend and got some. And I've just carried on from there. 

Wife and kids don't deserve this shite, yet I keep letting them and myself down.

You see everybody got a story to tell  
Well here's mine

My pain's deep, I have been through hell  
I managed to survive so I got a story to tell  
Listen, I stand victorious  
Make the sign of the cross  
Look I'm here to be the voice for every friend I ever lost  
Let me pray as I put together my hands  
I've never been ashamed to tell you the person I am  
When it comes to doing drugs, I have never been a rookie  
But hold up, let me tell you about the places that they took me  
I haven't showered, it's been possibly a week  
And I'm so deep in a psychosis, impossible to speak  
The coke is in my arm, now it's impossible sleep  
My throat's numb, closed shut, so it's impossible to eat  
Losing weight's a part of my daily routine  
I always use against my will, just praying I was clean  
So nod your head if you understand what I mean  
When I was growing up I never thought that I would be a fiend, ever  
My life's tumultuous, it's never getting better  
Another abscess from my arm is getting severed  
My exquisite vision, depiction of dereliction  
Livid living conditions, malicious on a mission  
All these Green-tree cops, look they all know me by my first name  
Paramedics had to revive me this ain't a game  
I worn the same clothes for like the last ten days  
And look I want to do better but I don't know a different way  
Completely all alone, I'm sitting in this room  
I empty out the bags, brown liquid in the spoon  
I have to do a lot, can no longer do a little  
The water's been added, I place the cotton in the middle  
I'm sucking every drop up into this plastic device  
As I'm tying off, I'm trying to find a decent vein to strike  
I shove it ever so gently up underneath my skin  
As I'm pulling back the plunger till there's blood in the syringe  
I push it in and try to drift away to heaven  
But criminals like me that's never the place that we're headed  
The guilt, shame, remorse and regret I never address  
And I'm a mess from all this pain and this anguish  
I'm filled with stress, overdoses,  
I'm emotionally broken, this ain't a joke  
I'm smoking on a Newport, I never have any hope  
This is me, I'm feeling like I don't deserve more  
I feel disgusted as I'm pushing on this burnt chore  
Someone stole the vinegar in the midst of a black out  
Another shooting gallery, another crack house  
On the porch ""Welcome To Hell"" is on the floor mat  
I'm glancing at my arms and all I ever see is sore tracks  
I'm feeling filthy dirty needles with the orange cap  
Peaking out the window, someone whispers ""Lock the door latch""  
We're blasting off, departing from this mothership  
I look around as others search the carpet for another hit  
Crest whitening strips and Mach 3's  
I'm on a suicidal mission till these cops try to stop me  
We boosted everyday selling steaks for half price  
Any dream I ever had was shattered by glass pipes  
Glass rose, devil got my in his lasso  
Entered the gates of hell and I didn't even have a pass-code  
I'm hard headed, I will never learn my lesson  
You know the drill, commit a crime, and get arrested  
The misery never ends, I spend another week in jail  
I don't have friends, family never paid my bail  
So I would withdrawal and kick on that concrete floor  
I feel like I've had enough but my body is screaming ""MORE""  
The food is horrible, but I haven't eaten in days  
No reason to call home cause I got nothing left to say  
I'm tired of this jail, I don't ever want to see prison  
Look I'm tired and exhausted from this life that I'm living  
I would get a couple days clean, and say that I was done  
But every time I got released I was back on the run  
It's back to thieving, lying, robbing, and ripping, and running  
These problems I don't solve them, I'm crippled and sick to my stomach  
I hang with prostitutes and these deadly degenerates  
I'm homeless for the moment, but that's really quite irrelevant  
The only thing that matters in life is my next high  
I got to be willing to change and give it my best try  
I'm a servant and this heroin's my king  
I'm feeling like a slave, as I dangle from these puppet strings  
I'm just a marionette, I'm staring at death  
As I am carrying regrets that are just tearing through my flesh  
We're dealing with a topic we're so careless to neglect  
We're dealing with a dilemma leaving every parent stressed  
I'm so sick and tired though of being sick and tired  
But then it finally happened, motivated by desire  
I hit this point, I wanted to change, enough is enough  
My efforts been exhausted and I'm tired of being stuck  
My faith is never blind and my future I barely see  
But overnight, was open minded I had this moment of clarity  
So it begins and it's essential I believe  
Cause if it worked for you, then it just has to work for me  
Through all this pain, there's got to be a positive message  
I talked about the past, now let's talk about the present  
I'm no longer living that way, for me it's a blessing  
But with one bad decision I am back in that obsession  
In 03 was diagnosed with hepatitis C  
I utilize the bad, it's always been the fuel for driving me  
And then u ask me ""Why do I give this my all?""  
I'm not trying to see ""Rest In peace"" on my Facebook wall  
I got clean in 05 and started rapping  
I started touching lives, I never thought that this would happen  
This shit today, trust me it isn't heroin  
It's killing everybody and the comments are disparaging  
No one cares or gives a fuck that I'm clean  
For them another deadly overdose is just something to see  
Look, I pay attention to every post that I read  
As you are sitting there judging in front of your iPhone screen  
Talking about these dying addicts and how they are worthless  
And if they put a needle in their arm then they deserve it  
But that's someone's Mother, someone's Uncle, someone's Daughter  
And that's someone's Aunt, someone's Son and someone's Father  
As I rap, this shit is giving me chills  
And I am speaking off experience, that's how I know it's real  
These ignorant motherfuckers will say it's not a disease  
And look I really don't care, you can believe what you believe  
I don't care to argue, I don't got to give you proof  
Listen, I was taught you don't got to defend the truth  
Incurable, progressive and fatal unless arrested  
I'm expressing aggression with every sentiment confession  
Once a junkie always a junkie, you're boring me  
The last time I checked, there's one ultimate authority  
I'm sick of these remarks and opinions from all these critics  
Cause if you never lived it, then trust me you'll never get it  
Be quite, you're not allowed to speak about it  
If you've never lived it, then you're not allowed to speak about it  
How often you forget,  
The only time that you should ever open your mouth is to eat a dick  
Everybody is dying it makes me sick  
This isn't a epidemic, this is more like an apocalypse  
So when I struggle, it's only right that I fight  
And my experience recites on how that diamond saved my life  
Look, you don't got a clue what I've been through  
When I was at my worst you couldn't walk a mile in my shoes  
I survived a lot, so it's only right that I smile  
And I'm aware of my surroundings, I'm no longer in denial  
I'm blown away by every message that I get  
It gives me motivation, it's the only reason I never quit  
We got to do this together, we must trust  
There's no you, there's no me, there's just us  
I'm doing this with courage, I'm doing this with pride  
I'm doing this for every single friend that's ever died  
I dedicate this song to anyone that's lost a loved one  
So live your life cause tomorrow may never come  
Be grateful for your past, embrace it, don't get embarrassed  
Everyday there is more children growing up without their parents  
I felt pain, look I'm not afraid to cry  
My life changed once I was willing to try",3,1

I stated that as a 25/m adult, they should not be contributing to my habits, and I felt $20 to my bank every weekday ($100 mon-fri) was wrong (not right). 

As hard as it is to admit, the truth is that I have a problem regulating with drugs and alcohol, even caffeine can be problematic to some extents (for example if consumed excessively).    

I sympathize for anyone in 1929-1930 for who would have had to gone through no money or losing their job did something out of their control (The Great Depression following the stock market crash in the fall of 1929).

62,2020-10-26 08:41:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jidt6t/types_of_addictions/,Types of addictions,"Off the top of my head, you can classify addictions like this: 

* Those that involve a substance and those that don’t.
* Those that are socially acceptable in Western culture and those that are not. 
* Those that mean big money for big business and those that don't. 

I'm sure there are many more useful classifications, but at the moment I'm only interested in how these three combine. 

An addiction to caffeine involves a substance, is socially acceptable and is probably big business for big business. 

An addiction to gambling does not involve a substance, is socially acceptable and is huge for big business. 

An addiction to porn does not involve a substance, is not socially acceptable (although this is changing) and means a great deal to big business (credit card companies, to start with). 

An addiction to weed involves a substance, is not socially acceptable and didn't use to mean anything to big business, although this might change with cannabis recently becoming legal here and there. 

An addiction to sugar does involve a substance, is socially acceptable and is absolutely huge for big business. 

I'm not sure if an addiction to biting one's nails can be said to involve a substance or not, I suspect it is low on the social acceptability scale, and I'm fairly sure that it means nothing for big business.",2,0

Ive been debated back and forth, back and forth about quitting this or quitting that, cutting down on this or that........ especially as recently my use/behaviours have gotten worse, more unmanagable.

 Current vices that have a hold of me are frequent (bording on constant) drug use, wreckless spending/gambling, and binging on candy. But in the past, I've engaged in self-harm, food restriction, binging and purging, hypersexuality...... and maybe some others I'm just not remembering right now. 

So, as things have been getting out of hand recently, I decoded I really, seriously needed to cut back. At least on the spending/gambling, as it's eating away at my savings more than anything else, and well as the candy binges, which are making me violently ill. And, I've had some success actually, cutting out the gambling, cutting back on the spending, and cutting back a little on the sugar. But, my drug use has ramped up as I've done this, and I keep catching myself lured into thoughts of restricting again, feeling the pull to b/p, or start freely cutting again, have thoughts of engaging in risky sexual behaviour.....

And i realized I've been down this road before. Struggle with one addiction/self-destructive behaviour, successfully cut down on it or stop, I engage in another to takes its place, rinse and repeat. And i had the thought, ""yknow, if I'm ever to be truly Well or Healty, someday I'll have to stop ALL of these things, every single one, at once"".

And I tried to envision what that would look/feel like..... and I couldnt. It was unfathomable. I tried to emvision it and felt like I'd come up on a brick wall. It felt so strange. Idk. What would i even think about? What would i DO with my time? So strange. I can't envision a world without the struggle, with the constant juggling of behaviours, or the back and forth, or the Cycle. Engage, get worse, cut back/stop, engage in new thing, get worse, cut back/stop, engage, get worse, cut back.............. 

Is that a stupid thing to think? ""What would I even do""? The answer should be ""be with friends, get a career, engage in hobbies, enjoy new things"", right....... and I think that is what i would WANT to do, but I have severe ADHD, which makes actively engaging in something a struggle, if not sometimes impossible. It leaves me listless and unable to focus, constantly. But with addiction or fixations, I dont have to really evem actively CHOOSE to engage, it's more like bei g possessed or compelled by outside forces, so even with my scattered ADHD brain I can ""focus"" on something, be pulled along to focused by force, in a sense, and finally have something to engage my brain without a struggle. 

So a world without may end up just being a world of watching seconds tick by and I'm unable to do anything else. Frustrated by my inability to do fun things or move forward, but unable to occupy my brain with anything else. 

I should probably get my hands on ADHD medication, someday. But as someone traumatized by the psychiatric system, and also someone poor with no insurance, and also considering how difficult it is made to get ADHD meds prescribed to you....... what a nightmare uphill battle that would be,,,",1,0

I have become addicted to coke and I need help. It all started when the pandemic and ensuing quarantine hit. The isolation became crushingly lonely and triggering for me (I’m recovering from a very painful breakup too). I ended up partying with a friend, doing coke a few weekends in a row. We stopped together, but I kept going alone.

Weekend binges turned into usage during the week. This lead to me missing work and getting into trouble.

It’s also led to anxiety provoking debt as I blew my paycheques on coke instead of bills. Thank goodness I paid my rent. 

I am so ashamed. I feel so depressed. 

I last binged Friday night. Yesterday, I slept all day. Today, emotionally, I feel like death. Not suicidal but you know, depressed as shit and hurting fiercely.

Tomorrow, I have an appointment with an Addictions counsellor. 

I can’t keep going on like this. I’m facing serious job and financial consequences. 

It all seemed to happen so quickly, my addiction. But at the same time, it’s been months. 

I feel so lonely too, which is difficult to shoulder along with the cocaine withdrawal. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story in case anyone is going through the same thing. 

Or if you have any advice, that’s also welcome. 

Even just a kind word.

I want to quit everyday but I have to keep taking the things to stop seizures and the withdrawal symptoms. I tapered myself from 8mg clonazepam daily to four and it was the worst experience of my life an still not even over so now my psych is gonna put me on a reduction plan I assume over 6-12 months but how do you even cope with that? To keep taking the drug you hate experience withdrawal which gives you anxiety which triggers your need for the pills in a vicious cycle. And how do you cope once you want to quit with accepting being a fkin potato or to put it nicer having my life on hold. Like in conversation and college I cant think clearly even though I know I can because of the goddamn benzos blocking my vocabulary and references. Also is weed a good distraction while your quitting if anxiety isnt the issue or does it exacerbate the problem. Honestly my plan is to go sober for around 5 days if I can in a few days then go back to  2mg idk.

Went thru fucking hell, literally could write a book or a movie about the plot line of this crazy delusion/paranoia/hallucination i went into when they tapered me off within 4 days. 

Fucking assholes i should have made sure they would do a proper taper before going but i was in a dark place, spending $150 every 3 days on bars and shit. All my money went to it.

I became this person my friends didn’t like, my family worried about, i was self absorbed and absolutely dramatized every single thing. Had benzo rage and made stupid life altering decisions.
Made me lose my scholarship and ultimately have to drop out of my first year at university.

Crashed my car 3 times because of bars.

So the thing is i can clearly reflect on how bad that was for me and all the shit i fucked up on, i can recognize that. I recognize it almost killed me from withdrawals. I had to be sent to a psych ward from the detox center and then from the psych ward to the ICU for 2 days in a fucking medically induced detox. Then 4 days in the hospital recovering before going back to rehab. Tubes were in me everywhere.. Even down there  too... 

it’s crazy though, my mental state was so far gone and i was put on a bunch of crazy meds in that psych ward that i was so oblivious to what was going on i was in my own world. I hallucinated my phone in my hand when i closed my eyes. Every night i would dream some crazy illegal shit happened and i had superpowers that let me teleport back to the psych ward. I was communicating to people from different places through the detox room wall. I could go so far deep into what i remember it was like a story. Anyways...

These things fucked me up! 

Yet almost every damn day damn near a few times a day i get some pretty intense cravings and for some reason even after all that hell i endured my brain tells me to keep seeking it out? I’ve relapsed three or 4 times since getting out of rehab in April.

I just don’t know what to do, because i think of benzos all the fucking time and honesty would be getting them if i could, but i wanna stop at the same time.

Do you want to waste time on addiction for entire YEARS of your life, or do you want to spend it achieving stuff, not to mention likely being more energetic and confident when being free from your addiction and requiring less sleep etc.

This has also got me thinking more strongly about quitting social media and other bad habits that add up",1,0

I know that it’s dangerous each and every time. My addiction started due to surgeries as a child and then being given massive amounts of prescription pain meds by my family doctor. I was raised in an abusive household with a drunk father. I had a lot of childhood trauma and the opiates not only numbed the physical pain but the mental pain as well. 

So Wednesday night we copped from one of two dealers we usually see. We’ve known this one for less than a year. The other guy we’ve known for over 10 years on and off. The guy told us he had some of the “good stuff” and when we got it he said to be careful. We stupidly brushed that off given how many times we’ve been told the same thing only to get junk. Well, he was right. I remember just a few seconds after injecting it and then it went black. Three doses of nasal narcan later and I started to wake up. 

At first I couldn’t recognize my husband. All I saw was a man’a face as I came in and out of consciousness. I then began vomiting and dry heaving every time I would come to. I was experiencing terrible precipitated withdrawals as I am a methadone patient. Each time I came to, I’d become a bit more clear. I woke up on the floor with my shirt off and my body covered in water, freezing cold. My husband got me stabilized and I slowly realized who he was. Before I knew who he was I just kept thinking he must be my boyfriend or something because he’s holding me and helping me. 

He had to shoot me up with dope from our main dealer to get me out of the horrendous withdrawals. After I stabilized he helped me take a shower and then sat with me for hours before we felt it was safe to go to bed. I have so much love and gratitude for him saving me. He keeps blaming himself but it was my own fault. He didn’t make me do anything. 

After doing some research on my symptoms, we believe the dope was laced with cocaine. We think I may have overdosed on both. Apparently I was convulsing and doing other things that aren’t typical of opiate overdoses. 

I took my methadone the next morning and haven’t looked back. My husband and I are both so terrified and so embarrassed. I’m lucky no one else knows. I’m lucky I’m ok. I’m upset with myself for ever getting to this point, but I know that thinking that way won’t help me get better. 

My husband saved my life and I have fallen even more in love with him. I am grateful for him and all the things he did to bring me back from the brink. I can’t imagine a work without him and I know he spent 30-40 minutes the other night truly thinking he may have lost me. 

Please let my experience make you think twice. I know how hard it is to stop using. I get it. I truly do. But I never thought this would happen to me and we are just so lucky we had enough narcan to save me. I couldn’t imagine putting my husband through me overdosing and dying. He deserves better and feels the same about me. I love myself and him too much to not let this be our rock bottom. 

Life is a beautiful gift. We need to cherish it and not take it for granted. We’ve got a long road ahead of us to get better, but I’m ready to do it hand in hand with my husband. I’m truly so lucky to have him.",5,0

It’s important to note that this offense has nothing to do with drugs. At first I understood where he was coming from, as I don’t want him to go to jail either, but recently I have been feeing a lot of pain, as it feels like I was ripped out of my home because my boyfriend chose weed over me. I tried to bring it up with him, but he got super defensive and hurt, and out of respect for his feelings, I let it go. I know probation is probably going to be a long term thing, and I feel like I’m in limbo because whenever I bring up the future sentence, he just says that we will deal with it then, but the way we are dealing with it now leads me to believe the same circumstances are going to apply.

I'd get a DUI and be court ordered to AA...but, then I'd go out drinking again.

Prayed to God for help.

I'd be living in a halfway house, and have to go to AA meetings as a requirement to stay there...and I'd go out drinking again.

Prayed to God for help.

Was in jail, and AA would bring meetings inside the jail...would get released and go drinking again.

Prayed once again for God to help me.

A story that relates to my experience:

**There was a certain man who lived along a river. During a terrible storm, his property began to flood up to his front door. He and his neighbors were visited by the local Fire Department and told to evacuate.**

**When the fire truck came to his house, he said, ""I'm staying. My faith is in God, He will save me."" The truck drove off. The man went inside to pray.**

**And so, the flood rose up to the second-floor windows of the house and the man was then visited by a rescue-boat, and again the man told the rescuers, ""My faith is in God, He will save me."" The boat sped off without him. The man went inside to pray.**

**Finally, with the water level all the way to the top of the house, the man was standing on the peak of his roof, and a helicopter flew over and dropped a rope-ladder down, but the man refused, screaming up to his would-be rescuers, ""My faith is in God, He will save me!"" The helicopter flew off. The man sat on the roof and prayed.**

**In time, the flood rose, drowning the man.**

**When the man got to heaven, he was furious that God had not saved him from the flood. He said, ""Lord, I strongly declared my faith, confident that you would save me. Why didn't you?""**

**God said, ""I sent you a truck, a boat, and a helicopter!""**

Today, I'm 10 years sober in Alcoholic Anonymous and so glad I grabbed the rope ladder. The people of AA were the ones in the truck, boat, and helicopter. AA just might be the answer to your prayers...your rescue sent from God, or the Universe if you will. I always thought it would come some other way. Something to consider. Best to you!",9,0

Last night he snuck out of the apartment at 1am.. I woke up realizing he wasn’t next to me. He came home and said he went to get cigarettes. I knew he was lying already. I caught him in the bathroom doing something that I could not figure out. He ran out of the bathroom and shoved something between the couch cushions. I grabbed it and realized what it was. It resulted in him trying to grab it out of my hands which he failed doing. I flushed it. I went to the room crying. He had the nerve to come in and ask if he could go back out to get more and it be his last time to ever do it. He said “now that it’s on my mind I have to have it tonight.” I told him I was sick of living the same nightmare and that if he leaves to get more that will tell me that I am not a priority in his life. He will go six months and be fine.. everytime I start thinking things are going well he goes right back to ruining everything. I went to bed after he told me he would sleep on the couch. I took his keys. I went to check on him 15 minutes later and he was gone. He hasn’t come home since and his phone is off. He’s on the lease so we can’t kick him out. He has refused in the past to get help. I can’t continue to be with someone else is constantly breaking my heart and I can’t leave either because I will have nowhere to go and everything that’s in the apartment is basically mine so it wouldn’t be fair to my roommates.

Alright onto the post, I really hope this one doesn’t drag out as long. Usually I never know what exactly I am posting about, but due to writing multiples I have an idea. I also don’t want to waste anyones time, so going to jump right in.  I have a new addiction to add that I have never once taken serious to add to the personalities grp. The new addiction is self sabotage, over history and combined with a fear of success I have somehow built paths that have lead into the same wheel of fate. I use to be glad of an addictive personality because I told myself that hey,” you don’t have to be so anxious and afraid because when you start to go farther something usually another addiction always pulls you back into a new temp way”. As I got older, more and more I hated it and saw how weak and pathetic of a  being I was, I could never trust myself with anything in life. All it takes is self control and moderation, but no sir instead you are an ugly beast and therefore your downfall shall be beastly. Well I just recently lost a nice job I liked, but many people have been experiencing it for sometime. Who the fuck am I shit I deserve it, so what am I to do now, I know what I should do but I know what I will do. That is when I truly feel that fear and uncertainty, pushed into a corner again facing all these multiple addictions, not knowing which one I want to be swallowed whole by. So instead we take something from them all, but what happens when most of them are at their change point, even now I found myself thinking of the harder things I once forgot. I know I am weak and pathetic and there are people who have it truly hard in life, so I apologise for being garbage. Tbh when I think about this post I am still lost….. Then it hits me- The original plan involved a lot of spending on substances. So idk maybe reddit has also been another new rising  addiction, but how many times can I stimulate the end before I really want it.",1,0

Link to video: [https://youtu.be/6FKZKNlvqJY](https://youtu.be/6FKZKNlvqJY)

&#x200B;

My story:

 I had been smoking weed for 18 years every single day. Weed was basically my personality through my teenage years and it was who i was for a very very long time. I abused alot of substances in those 18 years but weed was the one that was there every single day.

&#x200B;

I used to be an actor and be extremely creative but the last 8 years i got stuck working in bars and restaurants. In June i started streaming since i was gaming all day might aswell stream it. One month went by and i started getting really creative with it. Making characters to interact with on the stream. Dressing up as my imaginary cousin and making conversations with myself. Just got a huge burst of creativity.

&#x200B;

One night i was sitting in my bed after a really good stream thinking how much i enjoy being creative and then i started spiralling in my usual stoned overthinking loop and doubting everything i had achieved in my short streaming journey. It became very clear that if i want to continue i need to escape the selfdoubt spirat and overthinking that being stoned put me in. Next day i woke up and did not wake and bake. The day went by and i just used all my energy to create stuff and not smoke. I made the first day so i said ok lets see how far we can go with it.

The next 4 weeks where the hardest. My heart rate was out of control doing up and down in a matter of seconds even when i was sitting down. I would sleep for maximum 3hrs and wake up in a panic mode (this is still happening 2+months later). Mood swings, rage explosions and general instability where the main mental issues to deal with. 

Streaming was for sure the one thing that kept me out and tbh i didnt even crave it that much. Looking back it was so much easier than i though it was. And i think its because streaming had me hooked in so hard and it was not really streaming it was just being so creative making my own emotes gifs alerts videos songs costumes dances everything. Im not gona sit here and tell you dont do drugs cause drugs are extremely fun. But if you do wana quit get creative with something.",41,0

so I used to be a really smart dude who had some great visions and ideas regarding life, but 2 years ago I started smoking weed, got thrown out of my house and afterwards I went to stay at a friend who also takes drugs (at that time i only used to smoke weed).
And because this fucker influenced me to take drugs (still my fault but hate this guy so much aaaaarhgh!!), I tried a different range of drugs like alcohol, exstasy, cocaine, speed, lsd and god knows what else...
now 2 yesrs later after I started smoking weed, I am here and I feel like i fucked up every bit of brain cells I had, I barely can remember anything up to 3 days maybe even less. I notice that when I learn something new the information really doesnt stay and It feels really hard to recall information. It really feels like the drugs have taken away all the cheerful and intelligent soul I have once been. Trouble regarding mood and confidence isnt really bad to be fair i still feel confident, but it just that i feel like its nlt worth struggling in life anymore as Im prolly dumber than most people when Im in a room. 

and another big thing is, I feel like this shit also has given me erectile dysfuncrion, my dick barely gets hard even when Im horny and its maximum at 30% strenght, which is even a bigger trouble... 
i just hate drugs...

tl;dr : been taking drugs continuosly for 2 yesrs and feel like I fried up my brain and my penis and want to know if theres going back to normal

He's living alone right now because my mom had to file for legal separation (she's in a court case and can't have my little sister with my step-dad living there. can't say i'm not relieved, even if it is at his expense), and I'm worried about him. I want to show him support, but we've never been very close before. I don't know what to do. Are there memes I can send him, or would that be insincere?

I started abusing codeine (specifically Nurofen Plus) about four months ago. I didn’t rag it and didn’t really feel dependent but I suppose you never do until you sit and think about it. 
 I’ve had trouble with anxiety and depression in the past but have overcome this with diet, exercise and yoga. Recently I’ve entered into a relationship with a girl who I’ve moved in with and my issues with stress have kinda come back - she has an extremely stressful job which sometimes means our relationship has to take a back seat. I can cope with this out she can be moody sometimes,   nothing really major. I mention this because she doesn’t know about the codeine and I DON’T want her to. Unfortunately that will not be an option so please, I know it’s good advice to come “clean” but that isn’t an option. 

 I was taking between 20 and 30 tablets (240mg - 360mg) say about five/six days a week, for about the last three months. The last time I had some was Friday of last week so I’m on my fifth day of being cold turkey today. 

The physical side of things has actually been fine, took some immodium for a couple of days to cope with the shits and physically I’m pretty much ok, I’ve started working out again. 

The problem I’m having is that I’m severely depressed and anxious. Also my sleep is becoming increasingly disturbed and I’ve woken up panicking a few times in the last three days. She’s going on holiday with her family at the weekend so thankfully she likely won’t notice the change in my moods but I need to ask:

How long does this tend to last? If I’m on my fifth day does this kinda mean that if I stick at it things should get better in the coming days? I can’t cope with not sleeping properly, I work full time as does she and it’s gonna end up causing problems and we’ve been through a pretty rough time recently together anyway (hence the codeine I suppose). 

I really, really need help and I can’t get it from the person I love and who loves me. Please help, I’ve never felt so low and I’m 37 years old.

I can't hit the strings in the way i wish, and it just sounds overall shitty to me. And my creative mind won't really open up to improvising and such.

So if you are a creative person who has kicked an addiction that used to let your creativity flow, i'd really like to hear how long it took you to regain a satisfying level of creativity??

So I’ve been an polydrug addict since I was 16, currently 20. I’ve been addicted to all sorts of drugs, DXM (robotripping), Adderall, weed, phenibut, alcohol, etc. I’ve either managed to quit them completely or at least cut back to safe/responsible infrequent use. Some that I can still use every now and then responsibly are DXM, weed, and phenibut. I quit Adderall for good in May 2019 and haven’t done it since. And most recently, I quit drinking back in May of this year.

While my drinking wasn’t anything insane compared to some, I was drinking a 6 pack every night, downed a handle of vodka in less than a week, and was all around bad with it. It was affecting my mood and my relationship and decided it was time to kick it. So I quit  in May and after withdrawals, I felt great!

However, this past Sunday, my family had a small party for my girlfriends birthday. Given my bad social anxiety even with my family I took a lil phenibut before hand to ease the nerves, wasn’t a problem. However, shortly into the party, everyone started drinking. My girlfriend, knowing of my struggle with booze, was hesitant but wanting to have some. Not wanting to be controlling or anything obvi, I told her it was fine if she did, no worries.

But then, between everyone around me drinking and the phenibut lowering my inhibitions, I decided I’d have ONE beer and that it wouldn’t hurt. After 5 months of drinking and with the pheni, it hit well. 

Fast forward through the night and by the end of the night I had a total of 3 beers. Nothing crazy but more than I wanted to at the start of the night.

Now I’m conflicted on how to feel. Cause on one hand, I didn’t go crazy and I haven’t had any since. But on the other hand my one turned into two into three, which somewhat shows my lack of self control. 

Now to preface, when I quit I’ve always said to myself that I’m not NEVER gonna drink again, but I won’t -today- and whatnot. 

So I don’t know how to feel. On one hand I feel okay about it but on the other I feel guilty. I don’t feel the need to drink again which is good. But I’m just not sure what to think ya know? 

I’m not sure if I’m looking for advice or what but I just felt the need to get this feeling out. Anyone else ever have this conflicted feeling?",1,0

I’ve been a Tramadol addict on and off for the past 5 years, mostly on. I gave up the drug for almost 6 months last November, but I’m sure like many of you I relapsed once the stress of this pandemic really amped up. 

I was working in a medical supply store, mostly providing oxygen to patients. The stress that COVID brought with it was too much to bear, and I started using again in May. It started out just here and there, but VERY quickly became a constant use. It was like a security blanket for me, and in that stressful situation the warm embrace of an old crutch was too much to pass up. No one in my family knew I had relapsed, and they still don’t. Not that they aren’t all incredibly supportive, and non judgmental, but I just couldn’t let them down again. 

Two months ago my wife and I moved to a new state and I started a new job two weeks ago. I’ve been clean again for 3 weeks, and I really do feel good most of the time, but there are still those moments that I have an overwhelming urge to use. Anytime something stressful happens, or I’m in a situation I don’t want to be in, my first thought is to go searching for any pill I may have misplaced in the past. While I was clean for 6 months that happened less, but it never stopped. Not really confident it ever will.

I was already in the process of recovery but her death really cemented it for me. She was who made me stop for good past the relapses. She was a very close family friend and one of the best people I knew. She was incredibly lonely, but so loyal... It breaks my heart knowing who she was. She just stuck with the wrong people to a fault to be honest with you. She hung by them even if they didn't deserve it.  In the past 3 years I've stopped all hard drugs. I do drink drink a few beers for work functions as well as special occasions.. but I think of her often. I feel so sad. I wonder if that should've been me. I always told her when she was here..

I attended her funeral when I was coming off drugs. I laughed during her funeral because I knew if she was alive she would be cracking up so hard. I knew it in my heart. It was this crazy catholic effigy with her full name in song. Think of Korean people singing ALEXANDRIAAAAAAA in a Asian Hymn. She would have found that to be hilarious if she was here.  I felt crazy but I missed her. I had a relapse, doing LSD a year after her death. I thought I was dying (physically dying) and going crazy. Apparently the whole time I was getting hit by some cops (whom I asked to be called during all of this) and I was screaming her name while being beat and hospitalized.

VENT post and advice welcome.,"I have taken 6-7 40mg including one 50mg of vyvanse over the course of yesterday afternoon to 12pm today. 

Obviously I feel like complete hell. I feel like a failure. I feel so damned ashamed of myself. I didn't want to quit because it felt good. I wanted to prolong the good feeling and ended up making myself sick. On top of risking my health, I just looked at porn from 10pm to 6am this morning.  

I have done this binge two weeks ago and in the past. In the past I had managed to reach out for help from my grandma and flushed the pills while she was on the phone with me.  

I have recently moved 2000 miles and have this idea in my head that I will not be able to be successful or happy without them.  It stresses me out to think about getting rid of them and confiding in my Dr.  about my binging. 

I manage to get myself back on the prescribed amount (one pill for work/school) and then get the confidence to get behind the idea that I am abusing the pill and myself and take a week off taking them at all.  

Yesterday, I knew I was going to take one. Even though I had a streak of five days not taking them. Getting through work without wasn't terrible. However, getting home and to the mountains of work there, had me reaching for a ""boost"".  

Later towards the night, after completing everything on the to do list and much, much more, I started feeling lonely and took another and grabbed the phone and autopiloted to the porn. For hours. While every so often popping more vyvanse. 

I am a tired mess right now, y'all. My heart rate is I'm the 124 just walking. Usually it's 65-70s. When I stood up there was lots of immediate pressure in my head, behind my eyes, and in my ears. It felt like the start of a panic attack that would stop once I laid down. My muscles are tense and I forget to breath.  I am nauseous. Headache. Etc. Stung out.  I chewed an aspirin and have been drinking water, gatorade, and had a kombucha.  

My physical symptoms have lessens, but emotionally I feel so much shame. For hating that I still want to take another one, even though I know it won't do anything good for me. More shame for not having taken care of those fucking pills already. Not wanting to cancel my prescription and talking to my Dr. about my abuse. I STILL WANT THEM, after all this shit I still want the pills.

What follows is a comprehensive account of my experience with alcoholism and chemical dependency, and how my life became completely out of control and unmanageable. I nearly lost my life to addiction, and I'm both lucky and grateful to be alive. This is all about awareness, and something I've worked on for quite some time. I think it's a story worth sharing. Unfortunately, I've had to tweak, delay and even add to it, due to several relapses and slips. I talk briefly about my life in active addiction, and a little bit about my past and the lead up to my reliance on alcohol and drugs. I then discuss the chaotic and manic episodes, hospitalizations, injuries and both visits to rehab. Finally, I give an account of life post-treatment and my own views on addiction. I did my utter best to put things chronologically. This is heavy stuff, just to clarify. Reader discretion is advised. It's not all war stories but they're a vital part of the overall account.
I inflicted pain, anger and sadness upon myself and others for several years. Just for clarification, I'm not trying to act as if I'm some sort of expert in recovery. That's not my intention. I could fall off the wagon tomorrow, and it's happened. The third part is what really matters, personally anyway. The past can be such a burden, and it's what lies ahead that’s important. I took little pleasure in writing the vast majority of this, bar the end. It was difficult. It's all been shared with my current counsellor and psychologist. There is truth and honesty throughout. If it has a positive effect on even a single person, then it was worth it.
Here goes something...


• PART I 

For several years, I've struggled with alcoholism and more recently, an ever increasing reliance on drugs, namely cocaine and amphetamines. Alcohol became my true demon though. There's a history of alcoholism on both sides of my family and I'm clearly no exception. Perhaps, I was born an alcoholic? Perhaps, not. Regardless, I became one, and a chronic one at that. Addiction took hold slowly, over the course of a few years. I had my first drink at 14 and continued to drink socially until I was 19. Since then, I'd been completely reliant on alcohol and had been drinking every day until not long ago. 2018 is when I began drinking as soon as I woke up. It got to a harrowing point where I could not be without alcohol for more than a couple of hours. I became so reliant on it that I had to drink to prevent delirium tremens and just to feel normal. I was a fidgety mess when completely dry. I couldn’t stay still until I had drank an adequate amount. My hands would be trembling uncontrollably every morning. The cure was always there beside me, for when I opened my eyes. Before drinking a litre or more of spirits per day, I drank roughly eight cans of cider and a bottle of red wine daily.
I had my preferences but it didn't really matter what I drank because I'd drink anything in front of me. I just needed volume, and lots of it. I spent a lot of time in the pub, both after work and on my days off. That is more or less what a social life entails as a young Irish person, and I think most people can agree on that. The problem with alcoholism is that there is never any down time. I drank when I was happy, when I was sad and everything in between. I just drank. Guzzling down litre bottles of spirits on a daily basis meant that I have no recollection of days and even weeks during 2019 and 2020. I stopped using mixers and even pouring glasses, before long. I was drinking gulps, straight from the bottle. I suffer from an anxiety disorder and take prescribed medication to combat it. Prior to this, alcohol completely numbed me, and that became the essence of my drinking. Alcohol may have temporarily boosted my confidence and minimized my anxiety, but that anxiety was merely suppressed and just continued to develop. The elixir, being alcohol, began to do less and less for me. Due to this, anxiety became increasingly predominant. With my anxiety comes the dreaded panic attacks, that can occur very abruptly. Sometimes, I feel physically sick and will tear up at a moments notice. My heart rate goes through the roof and I can struggle to catch my breath. I can be in a state of fight or flight. They are not pleasant at all. I would avoid these attacks at all costs, which is partly the reason I developed such a problem with alcohol. As I've mentioned, I had to have alcohol at all times, and would never leave the house without it in me or on my person. All I could think about was where and when I could drink. I was unable to function or think clearly without it, so I would even drink small amounts in work, to stay level headed throughout the day. Sneaking away for a drink was standard procedure. When I wasn’t drinking, all I could think about was drinking. When I was drinking, I was making sure that I had enough money for the following day, to buy drink. 
Right, onto ganj. To this day, I'm convinced that it was weed which induced my sometimes crippling anxiety. I smoked it religiously for years, and I was most certainly addicted to it. I even brought it through airports, when I knew that I had no access to it abroad. It began to have a very negative effect on me after I turned 19. I could be sitting with friends, stoned, and swear that they were talking about me. I would be analysing every word they were saying. So much so, that whatever conversation they were actually having would go completely over my head. All I wanted was to enjoy it but I had no choice other than to give it up, for my own sanity. It was for the best though because weed isn't safe, and how it tends to be glorified is just silly to me. I’m confident that I was on the brink of developing psychosis from it.

From the age of 17, I began taking hard drugs. I took anything I could and did them at every opportunity. On school nights and even during and after school on week days. I'd take ecstasy for days until I'd no longer come up on it and take acid at home, alone. It became more than experimenting but at that time, I was actually proud of my drug use and recklessness. I slowly began to drift away from some of my close friends, as drugs became part of my life. Looking back, I find that somewhat distressing but at the time, drugs were more important. Friends noticed, and I was no longer being invited to parties and other gatherings. Since late 2018, I was taking cocaine almost every day. Most people I know were lucky enough to be able to get to sleep after a night long binge. I never quite had that luxury. I would eventually crash, due to exhaustion but that would generally be after another day without sleep. 
Almost every day after waking, I'd feel sick and was either constipated or would have diarrhoea, so I just couldn't win! I'd try to eat something and generally vomit it up. My appetite would come back after drinking a sufficient amount. I'd eat enough to fill me and then begin another coke binge. That was how I lived. My weekly wages were all spent on drink and coke. I often had no money for food or for the bus to work, and I was catching up with debts every week. It got to a point, towards the end, that I couldn't afford coke, so speed became my drug of choice. It was cheap and affordable. Therefore, I would take far too much of it. The days of social drinking, drug use and partying were long gone. I would tend to lie when asked if I had any drugs, and most of my using was done at home, by myself. I would drink and snort away every night, watching copious amounts films and television series. I was happy to get wasted at home, rather than go out. That was my clever ‘solution’ at the time.. In reality, that solution just worsened my already serious problem. I was great at hiding away in the night, but the sun would always rise the following morning, unfortunately. 
The fun of drink and drugs was becoming non-existent. As much as I despised the fact, they were my crutch, and were more important than anything else.

I'll briefly explain how I got to that point. At the age of 18, I was moved school for my final year because I was rarely attending any classes. When I did attend, I rarely cooperated with teachers. This had been the case since I was 14, and the moving of schools was completely against my will. It had been a long time coming. I have no doubt that most of the teachers and staff were delighted about my departure. I've owed thousands of euro for drugs over the years, and during fifth year I owed a large sum to several people. I stole a lot of money from family members and whoever else over the years and felt sick from guilt. I had to ask for lends when stealing wasn't an option. I was under a lot of pressure at the time and bills were all I could think about. They were the first thing on my mind in the morning and the last thing on my mind at night. I'm sure a number of people can identify with this. I had to ask my parents for a bailout at least three times, so they had had enough. 
Onto my new school...I've never really had a problem making friends but I struggled in sixth year, due to my anxiety. I was unsure what was wrong with me at the time though. There was also the fact that I did not fit in at all in a private school. There was absolutely no fun to be had and that was far more important to me than taking part in any syllabus. Before long, I was doing what I knew and did best, not going to school.. It's no surprise that I ended up dropping out, just two months before sitting my leaving cert exams/SAT's. 
Being a school drop out was great at the time, or so I believed. I didn't have to study and wouldn't have to share my awful exam results with anyone. I spent the days drinking cans because I didn't have my precious weed to rely on. People would jokingly say ""Shane, you waster"" and I would laugh away with them. When the leaving cert results came around, I was unemployed and I began to realise that I was exactly that, a waster. After being unemployed for far too long, I managed to get into college with a portfolio. I was doing film studies which was the dream, but my old habits soon caught up with me. I had planned to be a star student but my attendance was almost non-existent, and I only made it through most of first year. I pleaded with the staff to allow me to repeat, and so I met with the college counsellor. I explained my substance issues with her and she mentioned a mitigation, which was good news. Even with that though, they would not have me back. That was in mid-2018. I was drinking all day, every day by now. It was most definitely the beginning of my downfall, and I slipped deeper into alcoholism. 
I was devastated about being dismissed from college, and so I was just barely scraping by. I lost a couple of jobs over the following months. I'd call in sick and have, what I thought, were great excuses to not go to work. I was kicked out of work on New Year's day for being visibly intoxicated. I was confronted about it by another chef, and so I flipped out and threw a ramekin at them. I missed, and luckily I wasn’t fired. Over the years, I'd been to a couple of counsellors for guidance. I wasn't willing to help myself, and so most counselling sessions went nowhere. I would drink before all my appointments. I did the same before going to AA meetings. I would eventually see a psychologist and a psychiatrist for further help, while in treatment.

• PART II

My first addiction related hospitalisation was the most serious. I had been drinking and drugging heavily, and swallowed a week's prescription of blood thinners. It was a suicide attempt. Why did I do it? I had genuinely given up. I didn't care what happened to me, and I was done. After about 20 of the longest, drawn out minutes of my life, I began to feel very unwell. An ambulance was called for me. Upon arrival at the hospital, I collapsed in the toilets (while inserting a suppository pill I'd been given) but I managed to crawl to the emergency cord, while fading in and out of consciousness. I was more concerned about pulling my trousers up before the nurses came bursting through the door. I was put on a stretcher and brought to a bed with immediate urgency. I was given multiple infusions to stabilise me and had a urinary catheter inserted, to prevent kidney failure. This was extremely painful, as you can imagine. I was watching my blood pressure plummet on the monitor beside me. There were at least four nurses gathered around me. They were shouting to each other, as if it was some kind of ruckus. They kept telling me to close my eyes, so I knew that I was in serious trouble, and that I may very well die lying on that hospital bed. I was scared, naturally. I really didn't want to die at this point but was somewhat prepared. I closed my eyes and hoped for the best. Luckily, they did stabilise me and I spent 24 hours in CCU, and a following two days in another ward. The staff kept telling me how lucky I was.. That fact sinks in a little more with each passing day. Had my friend not called me and my sister not been home, I would've fallen asleep and never woken up again. The head doctor pleaded with me to quit alcohol and drugs. “That's a tall order"" I replied.                                                                                                                                    
Apparently, I hadn't learned a fucking thing though, because I was hospitalised twice in a week, several months later. The first, for alcohol poisoning and falling flat on my face, onto concrete. I was so drunk that I struggled to remember my name, when asked by the nurse. I was covered in cuts and gashes and needed stitches in my knee, as well as a CT scan. I lost quite a bit of blood and still have scars. The second visit was due to chest pains and having difficulty breathing, after meth use. My heart had to be monitored for two days. I said I wouldn't take meth ever again but was back on it, just several days later. It's the goddamn devil's dandruff, and a disgusting drug. If that wasn't enough, I ended up in hospital twice in a single day as well. I arrived at a Dublin hospital in the early hours of the morning, due to self harm. It wasn't serious at all but I insisted on calling an ambulance anyway. I was discharged after a few hours, but no more than three hours after that, I was drunk and passed out on a street in Dublin. When I came to, I was in the same room, in the same hospital. I genuinely thought I had dreamt about being discharged. I quickly realised that it certainly wasn't a dream. I have absolutely no recollection of any of it.

When I was 19, I fractured my spine, while trying to pull a sign off a wall. As the sign tore from the wall, I fell backwards, onto the railing of a stairs. The pain... I had essentially broken my back and had to wear a shell type brace for six months to straighten it. I could have easily been paralysed. A couple people refer to me as “break the back"" or “snap the spine"". Fitting, I suppose.     I didn't always end up in hospital but a lot of my drunken/drugged up antics have ended in serious injury. A broken fist and nose, glass shards stuck in my knuckles after punching a window, violent seizure at a festival, third degree burns from a cigarette and a lighter, coughing up blood and numerous falls are a few of those injuries I’ve sustained. I'm a relatively kind and laid back person but I can turn into a monster after too much alcohol. I've punched walls and smashed windows in fits of rage. I broke my TV, camera lens, multiple phones and worst of all, my beloved PS4. I did this in public places too, and I would estimate that the damage is in the thousands. 
I had quite a tolerance for alcohol and drugs but I didn't know my limit. I would only drink spirits straight and do lines of whatever I had, back to back. As soon as I ran out, I'd be straight onto the phone to get more. Even though I had exhausted most of my resources, at that point. I would black out quite a bit and wake up with cuts and bruises a lot. I sometimes had no recollection of the previous night. I'm capable of anything while black out drunk, and have been told various stories the following day that made me cringe. I've been barred from several pubs in my hometown and in other places. Videos began to circulate of me lying on the main road in my hometown, blocking traffic in broad daylight. I was pissed drunk, covered in permanent marker and shouting at people. While I haven't seen the videos, some of you who know me have. I've been arrested three times, spent the night in a cell in Dublin and had numerous encounters with the guards. I’ve been fined at home and abroad more times than I can remember. Some of which, I’m actively avoiding to this day. I was barely sleeping at all and looked like death for the most part. I cared about my appearance at one point and dressed well, but even my own personal hygiene became unimportant. On several occasions, I didn't shower for days because it was far too much effort. I couldn't afford any clothes, so I'd be washing the same couple pairs of jeans, hoodies and t-shirts every day. I'm relatively neat and tidy but while in active addiction, my room and everywhere else would be a complete bomb crater.
On New Year's eve, a friend of mine breathalysed everyone at the table, for a laugh. My reading was so high that the breathalyser began to beep frantically. Supposedly, this meant that I was to seek help immediately. This just humoured me, and so I took another shot to celebrate. The reading was .411 but I continued to drink for several hours after this. That was my general attitude towards my problems. I had a tendency to send videos of myself to friends, while drunk and high. It would generally be light hearted enough but it could also turn very dark. I could be harming myself, swallowing tablets and breaking things. This infuriated people but I thought it was hilarious at the time. I was merely being an attention seeking asshole, and making an absolute fool of myself on camera... Some of those videos are extremely hard to watch. Friends, family and colleagues were all concerned about me. I simply laughed it off. Everything was a complete joke to me for a long time. Talk about denial!

I've pushed some of my dearest friends away, ruined a couple of relationships and hugely impacted my family. Even my parents were exposed to this other person I would become. My mother has called the guards on me, I've swung at my father and he has video footage of some of it. He more or less forced me to watch it, for my own good. In one video, I'm so fucked up on speed and vodka, that I was crawling down the stairs and laughing hysterically. It was disturbing. In another video, I had to be picked up off the road, after I was found passed out. I have absolutely no memory of how I got there, and a car could have easily run me over. Addiction turned me into a liar, and I became cunning and manipulative. I used people, even friends, for money and drugs. My sister moved out because she could no longer deal with my carry on. I would have parties quite a bit, and constantly disturb my neighbours. Even if I barely knew someone and they had drugs, they were more than welcome to come over to my house. It literally became a drug den at certain points. 
These kinds of things carried on for a long time. My parents even moved back in because of the constant bedlam in the house. I'm quite an emotional person, and was very in touch with my feelings when drinking large amounts. The more I drank, the more I cried. I was prone to having meltdowns and it was clear that the excess drink and drugs were having a serious negative effect on my mental health. Most people who were aware of my addiction just didn't want to be around me anymore. I was losing friends, and rightfully so! Regardless of this, I would lash out at them if they didn't contact me, and claim that they didn’t give a shit. Poor me, as per. I lost interest in all the simple things that once made me happy. I held onto my love of photography but my addiction followed me wherever I went. I simply couldn't escape it. No matter the destination, I couldn't outrun my own shadow. I travelled solo quite a bit and wasn't sober for any of it. I have no memory of several flights and train/bus journeys. That’s if I even made it onto the flight because I’ve missed three in total. I've crossed paths with police and security in other countries too. In Germany, up to five cops showed up at the apartment I was in because I was causing all kinds of commotion. It was directly after I had been mugged, and had some kind of shank put within inches of my throat. In Italy, I was told some fairly upsetting news, and so I pulled two lamp posts out of the ground and proceeded to smash them repeatedly. I only got slapped with a fine, thankfully. All of this anger was fuelled by alcohol and I was clearly incompatible with it. My doctor had told me this numerous times but I ignored all of his advice. I just could not stop. I was kicked out of my home for a couple of days during the infamous lockdown. No one would allow me to stay with them, so I slept out in a sleeping bag. I lay there with my bottle of gin, sipping away and wondering how the hell it had come to this. My life had become a far cry from how I intended it to be, years prior.

I'm quite used to trauma and have been to several family funerals, but when people my own age started to die from this disease, enough was enough. Whether it's an overdose or suicide, it's simply tragic and I was worried that I'd be next. I knew that I was completely out of control, and that I was running out of time. Time being my life. I'll never forget a text I recieved from a good friend of mine, (you know who you are) after I was discharged from hospital. I told him that I had cuts and bruises but I was fine. He replied ""You went to hospital, got kicked out of your house and you went to hospital. That was your week."" That text hit me like a ton of bricks. I was eager to take control of my life. With addiction, you lose touch with yourself, and your ability to mature naturally is hugely affected. I no longer knew who I was. I felt as if I was living outside of my own body at times. I hadn't been without alcohol for years, and I had no idea what I was in for.
I've been detoxed for sickening withdrawals and have been prescribed Librium on three separate occasions. This was for my own safety. The first time, I had no access to cocaine so I was breaking apart my Librium capsules and snorting the powder, while drinking straight vodka. I just needed the sensation of snorting something, no matter the risk of seizures, or even death. Librium works wonders but I couldn't always obtain it. I've experienced several cold turkey detoxes but nothing like the final two. I felt constant nausea and had a never ending panic attack that I couldn't shake off, even with my anti-anxiety medication. That was bad enough but the DT's that followed were by far the scariest thing I've ever endured. I began hearing voices and hallucinating. I felt as if things were crawling on me, and I could see spiders on the walls. My ability to walk was impaired because objects would pop out at me, and appear very sharp. I could hear whispers, coughs and shouts coming from around me. All of which were quite aggressive. They were quiet though, which made them even more ominous. None of this was actually happening, of course. That may sound like some sort of bad psychedelic trip, but my life was actually in danger. I imagine it's the closest I’ll ever get to experiencing schizophrenia, finger crossed! I did have another seizure, eventually. I woke up on the ground and my jaw was almost locked in place. There was blood in my mouth, and so it was blatantly obvious what had happened, considering it wasn’t my first seizure. My brain couldn't comprehend the sudden absence of alcohol, and so the rest of my body was trying to fill that void. I was so on edge, that even the slightest sound would make me jump. I couldn't lie down or stay still without panicking, so I would walk and walk for hours. Eventually, exhaustion would get me to sleep. I slept for nearly twenty hours on one occasion. That's my experience of withdrawals and I wouldn't dare wish them upon anyone. It's what heavy and consistent drinking leads to, simple as. They never get any easier.

In January 2020, my third intervention since turning 18 was about to happen. I knew for quite a while that rehab was inevitable. I was given an ultimatum, essentially. Go to treatment or leave the house. Everyone decided that rehab was for the best. Stepping into the first treatment centre was probably the most nerve wracking thing I've ever experienced. Arriving through the door is the hardest part. I spent four weeks there and found it very helpful. I'd almost go as far as saying that it was similar to some kind of course, and was even rewarding at times. Despite learning a lot and doing hours upon hours of therapy, I still managed to relapse on the day of my discharge. I lasted a pathetic eight hours before buying spirits. I didn't even give myself a chance at recovery...It's definitely true that relapse is a process and not an event. I had sub-consciously relapsed, long before I drank from the bottle. I was back taking amphetamines almost immediately too. I clearly hadn't wanted to get sober for ME. I did it for those around me. I wasn't attending after care or any of my support groups.
A week after my discharge, I was just as bad as ever, if not worse. I was with all of the people that I said I'd avoid, as part of my recovery plan. That's the consequence of relapse. Once it happened, I figured ""Ah fuck it, it's already happened now"" By May 2020, I had hit rock bottom. I was having an existential crisis and in a state of despair. In my illogical mind, I believed that everything around me was tainted and pointless. I was very unpleasant to be around. When I wasn't attracting unwanted attention, I would become frustrated if someone showed even a shred of positivity. I was quite willing to drink and drug myself to oblivion, and didn't care about anyone or anything. In reality, I was just being extremely fucking selfish and wouldn't take responsibility for any of my actions. Over the next two months, some of the injuries and hospital visits I've mentioned, came to be. Eventually, I was so worn out and miserable, that I threw in the towel. No matter my unwillingness and reluctancy, I came to accept that I was in need of further help.

In June 2020, I went to a different treatment centre, not knowing when I would be discharged. Keep in mind that this was merely three months after my first treatment. I chose to take things seriously this time, and began to comprehend the danger and scale of my disease. I was under no illusions, regarding my addiction. I scored 38/40 on a HSE addiction scale. I imagine most people's understanding of rehab is quite different to the reality. I was actually reluctant to leave at the end of my second programme, and even stayed for an extra day and night. I guess that I had become institutionalized there. Put enough humans together in a building and people are bound to clash. This took place of course, but there was a certain comradery between people there that I had never experienced before. For the most part, people just got on and the feedback recieved from others in groups actually helped in changing my life. Other people's hardships put my own life into perspective. 
I've heard some of the most horrific and heart-breaking stories from other patients. It's not always the counsellor who can alter your thinking or give you the best advice. I've met some of the greatest people from all walks of life. People who I would never come across, or associate with otherwise. In treatment though, we’re kindred spirits. No matter the age, addiction or illness. We may have all been in there for different reasons but everyone was there to get well. Some of those people will be friends of mine forever. Treatment centres are very private places, so I won’t be naming them. I was able to experience two very different kinds of treatment though. The strict 12 step, religous-ish route during my first stay, and then the more lenient, clinical and modern approach during my second “excursion"". Most of the first facility's counsellors are ex-addicts, whereas the other facilities staff are not. Both have their benefits but I'm an outright atheist, so I lean more towards the modern approach. I'm not spiritual, nor am I much of a 12 stepper or a higher power kind of person.

• PART III

Adjusting to life was difficult after treatment, and it took me a while to integrate back into normal life. Not that I had much of a normal life, prior to that. It's easy to stroll on through an addiction programme, please the nurses and counsellors, and go right back to where you were, upon discharge. I had done that. The real challenge is when you're back in the real world but are determined to stay sober. You might have changed but no one else has. The idea of life long abstinence scared the shit out of me. Believe it or not, I didn't stay clean, initially. I'll never be able to explain why I relapsed again but I got absolutely wasted a handful of times, over the following weeks. After being sober for a reasonable length of time, I’d feel like myself again, and so the inevitable temptation would set in. Whether it's alcohol or drugs, we addicts will always find a way to obtain them. So I'd give in, and things would undoubtedly and very rapidly spiral out of control again. Not once have I been able to keep my head after a relapse. It simply does not work. It's a thirst that can never ever be quenched. I'm really not able for another relapse. They become more and more detrimental to myself, and those around me. 
I've got scars and an anxiety disorder as a result of my years of carnage. There's a depletion in my liver function, and 11 years of heavy smoking hasn't helped matters either. I'd rather not have to take prescribed drugs to feel better, but it's made my life so much more bearable. Anxiety was really starting to impede on my life, and my capability of living normally. Not that I don't feel extremely uncomfortable at times though. I still find it quite difficult to sleep. Quite regularly, I wake up gasping for air, and struggle to breathe for two or three seconds. It's terrifying. Anxiety and all mental health disorders affect both body and mind, and they are very much connected.
I was in such a dark place for years, and though I was somewhat aware of that, I never bothered to do a thing about it. I just continued on my path of self destruction. This in turn, affected far too many people around me. The terrible episodes became more chaotic, and happened more frequently. I was going nowhere but to an early grave. I have no doubt that I would have ended up dead somewhere, had I carried on that way. I just want to point out again that I'm simply sharing my own opinions and experience. A lot of which I learned in treatment.
Addiction is complex, doesn't discriminate and there is no cure. It can sneak up and take hold of you, quite easily. I could fall right back into the depths of addiction tomorrow. Constant support is so very vital! Whether it be a chat with family or friends, AA, NA or even rehabilitation itself, the support IS there! No one wants to have to  go to rehab, and I most certainly would not have, had I not such a supportive family and friends.
You wouldn't believe how different it is though, and how beneficial it can be! I've known quite a few people who were or are in need of some sort of treatment. Not all of them are alive today. That's the reality of it. A couple of people I've known in treatment have died as well, and they will keep on dying. I weigh in or around 80 kilos now. Only six months ago, I weighed 65 kilos. Whatever I ate would come straight back up and I’d eventually vomit bile. I had absolutely nothing left in my stomach, except liquid spirits. No one should ever live like that. There was nothing rational about what I was doing, and it was a miserable existence. Addiction was like a war with myself. It was constant, and I was fighting battle after battle and losing, time after time. In a sense, that war still wages on. I continue to fight it every single day.

I do envy those who can put down a substance at will, and control their usage. It can be annoying but I've had to accept that I'm completely incompatible with alcohol and drugs. I had my fun when I was younger, but I know where my alcohol and drug abuse leads to every single time. Even before I ever touched a drug, all I wanted was to live the rock n' roll life, but that only leads to either recovery or death. I choose the formal. Some of the people I admire most are musicians, actors, comedians etc. who got clean. It’s quite the inspiration, and can be a useful tool in recovery. You can convince yourself you weren't that bad to begin with, or that you can control your using...it'll never happen. One of anything is too much, and 100 is never enough. To stay on the wagon, you've got to have a solid recovery plan and do the right things, consistently, every day. That being said, following a daily routine is all fine and well but it should be a routine that allows you to build a good life, and one worth living. The best piece of advice I've been given is as follows, ""When you think of drinking or using, just go with the second thought"" I would focus far too much on what I couldn’t control, drink and drugs. Therefore, everything else deteriorated a hell of a lot quicker, until I had next to nothing to work with. Now I focus on what I can control. I recently tried to calculate how much money I’ve spent on alcohol and drugs, just in the first half of 2020. It was absolutely shocking. So much money just discarded, and for what? Those hospital bills really began to build up as well...
I hope that someone, somewhere got something from this because I not only did it for awareness, but I did it for me as well. I have so many regrets and I've missed out on various opportunities, while in active addiction. I even had to give up my job because focusing on recovery was far more important. It's taken me a long time to really be able to live with some of my actions. I always remind myself that I'm a good person though, and that the good things I've done heavily outweigh the bad. Recovery alone isn't unconditional. I'm still trying to rebuild relationships with the people I've affected. Not everyone is willing to reconnect with me, and I have to respect and accept their decisions. I'd be lying if I said I didn't struggle or get cravings, I do. It's getting easier though, and I've genuinely never been happier.
I'm only beginning to feel grateful for all the simple, yet important things again. A loving family, caring friends and a reasonably healthy lifestyle. I feel composed and confident. Waking up at a reasonable time and feeling somewhat fresh is so relieving. I no longer experience the dreaded morning “fear"" of what I’d done or said the previous night. No regret, no vomiting and no reaching for a drink to settle myself. During active addiction, alcohol and drugs kept me occupied, but for all the wrong reasons. Boredom can really be a problem, so I try to avoid having too much idle time, as best I can. I started to meditate, if you can call it that. If only for fifteen minutes a day, counting my breaths. It’s actually really helped me. Getting in shape is proving to be difficult but I’m doing my best. I've started to read and write quite a bit again. I have a diary, or as I prefer to call it, a man journal. I’ve noted anything and everything. A passage from a book, a dream or nightmare, a new word and it's definition, a recipe etc. My current notepad is almost full. I was over encumbered with grudges and resentments over the years. I’ve managed to let go of most of them. It's purely fucking baggage. I’ve done my best to lose, or at least tweak some of the habits that plagued me for far too long as well. A lot of my general behaviour has improved. I feel that I’ve grown up a little, which is a small miracle. Not too much though, because where's the fun in that? This was all quite important because a lot of these resentments and habits directly related to my life in active addiction. A sort of factory reset, if you will.
It's also extremely important that I mention this. If ANYONE ever wants a chat, I'm here. I got so sick of people saying that to me but they always meant it, and so do I! I've sat with this essay for quite some time. The majority of it has been written for weeks and weeks but it wouldn't have felt authentic, had I posted it directly after a relapse. The time had to be right. I'm happy with what I've written here but it's not perfect, nor should it be. There's nothing perfect about addiction. Feel free to share this, especially with someone who might need a helping hand, or some guidance. Maybe it'll help, maybe not. As I've said, it's all about awareness and I'm not ashamed anymore. 

Take care of yourselves! 🙂",11,1

I myself just decided to go to AA (told everyone there my real problem and they were ok with it) Been thinking of hitting NA recently just because the AA crowd is way older than me. I have honestly sometimes wished I had a drug problem instead because 

1. Sex addiction isn't taken as serious even though it ends exactly the same (dead or prison)
2. It is impossible to get into a rehab because sex addiction isn't accepted by insurance
3. It is actually less socially stigmatized to say ""i had a drug addiction"" versus ""i had a sex addiction""

I’ve been smoking weed for two years, I smoked for the first time around 3-4 years ago but I have been smoking non stop for around 2. Just a little bit of background, around 3 years ago I started losing a lot of weight, I was at around 230 pounds and in the matter of 5-6 months I lost over 50 pounds. I didn’t look good (I was skinny and just looked weak) so I started working out and getting in shape. I was in the best shape of my life around 2 yrs ago, but then I started habitually smoking weed, and it didn’t stop. I have an eating problem when I smoke, like most people do. But now 2 years later I’ve gained back all the weight.

To be honest I feel like I am stuck, I’m at the point where I have no ambition and motivation to do anything or strive to be better. I look terrible, I feel terrible, but I can’t quite get off of weed. It’s really rough for me. I don’t know what I am going to do, and I feel like I’ve changed for the worst. My girlfriend is very supportive but there is only so much she can do to help me. I must help myself, but I don’t know how to break this habit. My dad smokes and has it in the house all the time. So I just smoke because it’s there. I want to get to the point where I can just say “no”. I don’t want him to stop smoking because that wouldn’t be fair. But I want to be able to just stop.

I’ve been smoking THC cartridges for about over a month now and the only reason i stopped is cause i had a seizure last night. This isnt the first time so i know it is the weed in the carts. But they’re the only subtle easy drug i can smoke and no one would know. Thats why its my go to. Life right now for me has kinda hit me with that “this is what life is really like” slap to the face. Being under 18 i never knew how shit life can get when you finally reach that number after 17. As much as people think they’re preparing us, they baby us. Life sometimes isnt a few gut punches. Sometimes its a 90/mph baseball hitting you in the jaw. And thats what I realized too late. I dont have enough room to describe my entire life story and thought process but im not someone who enjoys work. I enjoy pleasures and work is so off my radar, i might as well be named “The Procrastinator”. I had a dream not too long ago, to be an astrophysicist. It’s really a dream job. Understanding the universe for a living. But as i type this, ive practically dropped out of school. I can’t do it. School was never my thing and will never be.

For over a month i didnt have a seizure but everytime i do its cause i try to smoke whatevers left in the bottom of a cart like a fat guy cleaning leftovers.

I don’t really know why i typed this. I don’t expect anyone to have what im looking for but i think im looking for someone to pull me out of this pit. Someone to show me there is a brighter side and that drugs aren’t the only option. I want to be happy and reach goals but, im keeping myself back and Ive learned I can’t fix it myself.

If you’re actually still reading this, thank you it means a lot. A lot of the stuff i write are basically rants cause i dont have anyone to talk to (like my life wasn’t sad enough).

The thing is, he’s so HAPPY just after he’s had a smoke, and I love him so much, he is the love of my life... so I feel bad in nit-picking or denying him some pleasure — but therein lies the problem. Not wanting to confront him on it means it just goes on, day after day...

We met in 2014 and married in feb of 2016. We have two incredible young children, aged 3 and 1. We are happily married and I adore him, but the thought of being married to a man who smokes weed every single day of his life terrifies me.

It’s the first thing he does as soon as he gets home. He tells me it’s just a small amount, and it is I guess, but it’s every single day. Often multiple times a day. He is forever weed-hungover and it affects his mood. If we have sex when he’s smoked he can’t ejaculate, so it makes me never ever want to sleep with him when he’s high.

He works incredibly hard and I think he uses it as a numbing agent. He also had a pretty traumatic childhood with a mother who has severe anger management issues. He has never really addressed his childhood trauma and I can’t help but feel that it lies at the base of all of this.

He’s been smoking since he was 13. He’s now 35, so 22 years of smoking. My mum has smoked way too much weed over her lifetime and her brain is now degrading as a result. I’m terrified (and angry) about the prospect of my husband’s life being wasted with this drug. 

He’s had a couple of ‘clean’ periods in the 6 years that I’ve known him, but the most they’ve lasted is a few weeks.

More than anything, I’m frightened that he doesn’t even see it as a problem. I’m frightened that his mind is changing and he’s becoming someone I may no longer feel the same way about, if he continues down this road. Losing respect for someone is dangerous, and I feel he doesn’t care enough to want to change or take it seriously. When I talk about it being a drug addiction he looks at me like I’m crazy.

Please can you provide me with advice on how to approach it, how to get him help... I’ve tried to be understanding, for 6 years I’ve turned a blind eye, but I just can’t anymore.

Father is a 26 year “clean” addict (only taking prescribed drugs for legitimate medical reasons). But he uses sleep meds more than he probably needs to, and often stays up on them only to be in a totally-altered state. He’s not lucid. He has full conversations and tries to drive in his car, one time winding up with a large branch sticking out of the grill. Makes huge meals and winds up never eating them. The list goes on.

Sure, it gets him to sleep, but the current and potential damage it could do is much greater than the benefit of a few more hours of sleep. I’m worried that he’s unconsciously justifying this addiction because it’s a prescribed medication. He’s of the “I can take care of myself, I don’t need your advice. I’ve been through this all before” generation, so he feels offended if anyone gives him advice about anything besides technology.

Lol. I’m aware of how lame that sounds. However, at the time, I felt like I needed a couple hits throughout the day to take the edge off of whatever feelings I was dealing with. It’s now two years later, and I haven’t stopped. My vaping has gotten much worse and I am now addicted to nicotine. I have even smoked a couple packs of cigarettes since then (Haven’t touched them in over eight months, though, and don’t plan on smoking ever again). I’ve tried really hard to quit juuling because I can literally feel it impacting my breathing, as well as my mental and physical health. Yet, I continue to do it. This shit is seriously addictive, and I definitely underestimated that fact (even though that clearly state it on the front of the box). When you’re young, you believe you’re invincible and immune to the consequences that will inevitably lead to the harmful actions you take. Well, now I’m a bit older and recognize that if I continue to go down this path, I will eventually develop a health condition due to my lack of caring for myself and a lack of making a commitment to quit. I really want to stop. I’m just finding it really hard. I’ve quit on and off before, but I can never seem to quit completely. It’s hard, because my partner juuls as well, and we live in a household where others smoke cigarettes. I’m constantly surrounded by people smoking and juuling so I find it difficult to stick to my goal of quitting for good. Does anyone have any advice? Any resources that helped you quit? I would really appreciate the help. I want to do this for myself and making this post is the first step towards my commitment to myself. Thank you.",1,1

And I’m no doctor or chemist, but I feel like these days stims of any kind barely do anything. I will soon be trying 3-FPM, but don’t have super high hopes. I am also researching Cathinones. But, looking back, and even now typing this out, it seems crazy. But through the years I’ve tried a few times to let go of stimulants, but I become utterly useless without them. I can’t even get out of bed without some sort of chemical stimulation. These days a mix of a high dose of Adderall XR, Adrafinil, caffeine, Nicotine, and the occasional Methylphenidate are just enough to get me through the day. I wonder if at this point I could ever quit? I mean if I stopped right now, I’d lose my job, house, car, everything. I have a family I have to provide for. I can’t even imagine the damage I’ve done to my cardiovascular system and the dopamine receptors in my brain. Sorry for the rant. I guess mainly I wanted to ask if there is a life after years Stimulant addiction? Or am I doomed to always need a chemical to make me functional?",5,0

I am in a rough spot. Right now I am severely addicted to my phone, entertainment, external substances (not drugs tho) and am knowingly wrecking my life. It's like I know the thing I need to do to get out but I can't bring myself to do it and I wish I could talk to someone about I but I can't and so that lack of human interaction just leads me to seek more dopamine and spirals out of control. My work life is getting pretty bad, my sleep is absolutely fucked, and so is my self esteem and willpower. 

Mind you this is from a guy who has pushed through more severe shit before, even physically where I dieted for months on end doing strict keto cutting whilst surrounded by sugar and whatnot. It's just seeing myself fallen and unable to get back up that worries me. I am a hard-working guy but I seriously believe that lately all this stimulation has really broken me and I just don't know how to cut it off, namely because I want to make a presence in the social sphere. I could say I need a pep talk and motivation, but really what I need is a friend that can just talk and relate.

I know this isn't as severe as some other people's experiences and I apologise. I just don't know what else to do at this point and I had to force myself for an hour to write this down. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Any steps, easy to consume resources are appreciated.",1,0

Just stop. I understand it's beneficial for tracking personal progress and confidence but it may be impairing as well. There's a negative and positive. The idea is to make this sobriety journey the norm. That's the ultimate goal, correct ? By counting days you are telling yourself that it's not the norm and therefore it must be measured diligently (which isn't a total problem either). I'm not proclaiming that one should forget how far they've come but more so lean towards learning to live life outside of  a ""sobriety counter"".  This can also cause anxiety as one is fearful of relapse as the days go by. Just let go and live, don't let this hold you back psychologically. For example, if you were denied food for an extended period of time you would count days then because it's contradictory to the lifestyle you're used to. People do not count days they HAVE eaten as this is the norm for them and it's a apart of their daily lifestyle. This isn't intended to be a solution but just a branch on a tree of helpful ideology !",4,0

This stuff is impossible to come off of and I’ve kicked heroin in detox multiple times, it was cake compared to this. 
Now that I’ve been on 45 mlg for a few months my tolerance is building again and I’m getting sick at night and I’ve fought too damn hard to go up on my dose. 

Last time I tried to taper 8 mlg I got so sick I ended up vomiting and shitting for 9 hours straight until my bf luckily drove me to an urgent care about  5 min away from my house and they brought me in, in a wheelchair because I was too weak to walk. I’m 28 yrs old btw. I got a shot of Zofran to stop puking because I couldn’t even keep a pill under my tongue. 

I have REALLY good benefits with my job currently but I’m at the end of my rope and I’m absolutely miserable with my company. I’ve never been so unhappy doing any job and I mentally can’t take it much longer. Anyway, it’s nearly impossible to find a Detox that will get off Methadone- most insurance companies won’t touch it because it takes too long and they don’t want to pay for it. 

My brilliant plan? Replacing methadone with heroin, go to Detox and get off the heroin, work through my shit to find out what made me use to begin with (started using substances at 13 yrs old) and get on a mood stabilizer for the depression and anxiety. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me as I can’t afford treatment on my own and for detox it’s going to cost a whopping 3k with my insurance currently (btw the cost without insurance in the US is upward of 10k typically, out of reach financially for most people) so it’s do or be stuck forever on Methadone going up and up on my dose with no end in sight because my body keeps building tolerance to even my low doses. I feel horrible  at night, can’t sleep, my legs hurt. I’ve tried Kratom and it shot my tolerance up basically overnight to where I then had to use methadone and a ton of Kratom just to feel “normal.” 

I’m mostly just posting this because I’m so scared, the most scared I’ve ever been since I was a teenager in Detox dealing with this same shit and of course, it’s going to resurface if you just bury your problems in medication without getting to the root of your pain. This is the only way out for me and I know how crazy it sounds but I’m excited at the same time because I think I’ll have a better chance at this with a mood stabilizer, a support system and the necessary drugs in Detox to feel “comfortable.” I have too much to lose to go back to heroin and it’s not a long term solution for me as I have a house and two dogs that are like my children, a loving boyfriend, family. This is just how screwed up America’s healthcare system is and I feel backed into a corner.

However I am nervous about her tendencies, when she was 14 she was molested and after that started popping all kinds of pills and trying anything. Overall her personality in general is prone to addictive traits. However not long before we met she injected cocain for the first time, while I certainly think overall she has a problem there isn’t one thing that bugs her like that. Now she got clean for me, a couple stumbles and one time uses but ultimately she fought incredibly hard and continues to. She’s been clean of heroin and coke for nearly a year now (and honestly nearly 2 besides the one or two slip ups) so I genuinely know her heart is in it. She found a counselor online who is also a former addict and really seems to connect with him and help work through what she faces. 

I guess I just want to know how to ask about it. I want to know how she’s doing. I can’t be in the trenches with her I know but I can support her and just want to know what her state is. Her family has a history of problems, alcoholism, drug abuse etc. now one positive is most of those people recovered and are still sober decades on so she has a good example. 

I guess I just want to know how she’s doing, I want to spend my life with her but I am worried about the addiction, at the same time I know addiction is a lifelong thing and she has already taken huge steps towards recovery, I don’t want to walk away from someone I get along with so well when this is her only major problem and she still deserves that love. She never was on the street begging or using for years non stop just enough to get bad habits formed.

Hey gang.

Evidently, I have an addictive personality.

I have beaten numerous addictions in the past. I have been addicted to smoking: I now vape constantly, and I smoke perhaps one cigarette a day. I had a drinking problem for a few years, and now I can have a couple of beers with friends without going crazy. I used to have problems with all sorts of drugs, and now I'm a very occasional user. I still smoke weed on a semi-regular basis, but it's not a problem anymore.

Here's the rub: as I quit one addiction, I pick up another. I seem to be addicted to my own dopamine. This is a problem, because there are a few healthy ways of getting dopamine, such as leading a good life, but there are many more unhealthy ways. The unhealthy ways are much quicker.

The latest thing that I have dealt with is my porn addiction. It gave me a hormone imbalance which has made me fat and lazy. It has given me ED. It has made it difficult for me to interact with people face-to-face. I'm three weeks cold turkey from porn, and I already feel stronger, happier and more confident.

Here's the thing: I've started comfort eating to replace the porn. Comfort eating is not new to me, but it has got noticeably worse. I've decided to make a real effort to eat better and exercise more.

Since I have kicked most of my vices, I can only get ""high"" by experiencing extreme emotions. I have found a few ways that work. For years, I have sought out the saddest media I can find, be it movies, music, TV shows, comics etc. I want to experience things that hurt. I make myself cry, and I get a rush that makes me giggle. Goose-pimples. It feels amazing. I equate it to self-harm, except I'm hurting my soul instead of my body.

Less than an hour ago, I was on a subreddit that extensively features videos of people dying. It makes me feel sick to see, but I get a kick out of that sickness.

I don't want to do this anymore. 

I don't know how I became this person. My friends don't know I am like this. As an INTP, I am very good at masking. I am polite and conscientious around other people. I would never physically hurt anyone, or myself for that matter. I am in no danger. I just want to be better.

I need help. I don't know where to turn.",1,1

1). Videogaming
2). Fast food/junk food
3). Smoking nicotine 
4). Drinking 
5). Smoking weed 
6). Overeating 
7). Social media use

Backtracking on my lifestyle, I am fully aware that stress and weed among other emotions were the gateways. Of course, these are the traditional gateways.

Which to sum it up in a few words, fucking suck. I’ve been down this road a few times , i’ve gotten clean from this drug more times than i’m proud of. The withdrawls are not pretty and get worse as the days go on. I’m looking at 5 maybe 6 days of utter hell. 

This is why i’ve been scared to quit. If it gets out of control i will be going to an urgent care. 

Besides the dread of incoming withdrawal symptoms im pretty happy with my decision. Recovery is gonna be hard and coping with sober thoughts will get difficult but i’m feeling pretty confident. I’m ready to get my life back.

It is Never Love Again by Eminem from his recent album Music to Be Murdered By. I will say this, I wouldn’t recommend this song if you feel it may trigger your addiction and you might relapse. The song talks about Eminem’s own struggles with his drug addiction. The beautiful thing about this song is how he refers to his addiction as if it was an ex-girlfriend he is unable to get over. By the end of the song, he is able to finally flush his addiction down the toilet and is now 10+ years sober. This song has helped me understand my relationship with drugs and why it is so hard for me to let go. I am not ready to “break up” my relationship with drugs. I admire Eminem so much and aspire to reach the same strength he had to finally say no. I want to reach the point where I can flush my addiction down the toilet with absolute no regret, but I’m nowhere near ready. .... I hope this song can help someone in a similar situation.

I was bullied all my life, and when I moved away to university, within one month, my father passed away from a short battle with cancer. 

Since then, I've been up and down so much. I've been on explicit holidays that I booked hours prior. I've been so happy and motivated at times and other times I've been in A&E after trying to take my own life.

I've spent all my father's inheritence which was tens of thousands.

I first tried cocaine when I was 18 on a night out drinking and it made me feel amazing, confident, unstoppable etc.. 

Then my dad passed away, 
And soon after I tried cocaine again, 
It made me feel great. 
Then all of a sudden it turned into a spiral. 
I'd feel low, 
I'd do coke to cheer up, 
I'd feel worse, 
I'd repeat. 

I ended up going to get professional help for over 3 years, and I cut down from doing 3.5g every day to doing 0.5 or slightly more each week, 

My close family think I have stopped completely. 

My mother and nan know I have still been doing it. 

My mum and nan has been really ill lately, and stress is most likely the main factor. 

I have been contemplating just ending things and I just never seem to have the courage to do so. 

Don't worry, I'm not going to do anything stupid. I haven't got the balls. 

I just want things to end. I'm struggling so hard, it's making the closest ppl to me ill, I'm seeing them age quick... 

Does anyone have any advice for me to get better. I am intelligent, I am so business orientated and I just want out of this horrible cycle.

I’ve been doing it slow and steady for fear of a cold turkey but if all goes to plan tomorrow will hopefully be the last day and the next day will be the start of my alcohol free life. I came to this conclusion while laying plastered in bed wondering where the hell my life was going. This isn’t fun anymore. I’m only 20 and I’ve been an addict of something for longer than I’d like to admit. The reality is I’m watching my life go down the drain allowing my days to pass by like minutes filling my void with booze and anything to numb what I feel. I didn’t go out or barely leave my room everything I did I was hell bent to just get fucked up the very next second I could. I want my life back to start making art and music again and actually talking to people again. It’s time. That being said I’m fairly committed to my detox now and am hoping for good results over the next few days tho I feel my biggest hurdle is going to be in 2 months when I turn 21. Not only will everything be way more accessible but the pressure of going out and getting wasted with friends like everyone does on their 21st is going to weigh heavily on me. What my friends don’t understand is where they can go out for a night, get sloshed, and sleep it off the next day I cannot. It’s a never ending cycle of only waking up for the soul purpose of getting fucked up. I haven’t shared with anyone because I understand they’re not and haven’t ever been where I am and I’m glad they don’t know what it’s like but they wouldn’t be able to grasp the concept. The “why can’t you just stop”. I want to. These tremors, sickness, confusion, and spasms are hell and I wouldn’t want anyone to get it like how I do. I just wanna get through these next few days. I’m even excited to feel good enough to clean my house. But I can’t help but sit here and think I’ll never be like the normal people that can just go out and drink for fun. And no one fucked that up for me but myself. So if anyone has any suggestions or tips on getting through withdrawals and the next few days of detox it would be highly appreciated. <3",4,0

He's lost it all and is most likely depressed. Any help appreciated !,"Hey there reddit, i'm kind of desperate. And thought i could perhaps come across some advice from people 

Im 26 and i'm dealing with my younger brother (soon to be 23 this month) who is having a hard time with himself.

 He basically lost everything.

8k euro's to be precise, and is having a obsession with winning it back. While having severe mental setbacks and challenges, likely depressed probably too.

He's been asking for money so he could have a chance to win his money back, i've (not willingly) given him around 2K wich he lost within a day.

The day after he secretly withdrew 600 from my mother's bank account. This while she just came home from a operation at the hospital and is currently unable to do anything due to having to temporarily walk with crutches following the treatment.

After this he still desperately unapologetically asks for money to gamble.

Also, i love my brother with all my heart and id love to wear his burden on my shoulders for him. 

But it doesn't help that he's narcissistic, short-sighted, hard headed (in the sense that he always knows better than anybody) egotistical, hardly understands social cues or empathy. He's not stupid but also not the brightest. There is almost no reasoning with him or his logic.

He had a moderate breakdown and started pointing the fingers at us. For not confiscating his phone so he couldn't make this mistake.

This is what we are dealing with here.

The guy is very difficult to deal with. And its difficult for me and my family 

Me and my parents are going to try what we can to convince him to go to therapy or a gamblers anonymous type of gathering. Any professional help really. And this is nearly impossible to get done because you hardly can reason with the guy. But we'll see what we can do.

Any insight or outreach is appreciated guys..


EDIT: Also worth noting, he's done this before. Lost it all, won it back twice, wich may be why he's obsessed with gambling his money back",3,0
201,2020-10-11 13:02:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/j992ae/going_into_residential_treatment_soon_worried/,"Going into residential treatment soon, worried they won't take my addiction seriously.","Ok so, as the title says, I'm going into rehab soon. This has been a long and painful journey but one that needs to end.
My addiction is currently to lope.
For those who don't know, lope is short for loperamide, which is an anti-diarrheal medication. Its often referred to as the ""poor mans methadone"".
I have currently been on it for for nearly 7 years now and am currently up to 184 2mg tablets every 2 days.
This has caused several health problems that I now have to deal with. Including me having to get a pacemaker/defibrillator implanted into my chest. 

I have always wanted to get help for my addiction but several things prevented me from doing so. The main issue (the main concern I still have) is that no one will take my addiction seriously.

Now for a little backstory...
I recently lost my husband. He passed away very unexpectedly on july 24th of this year. He was only 34. His death was the worst of the many awful things we've endured this year (fuck 2020 amiright?).
He was also an addict(kinda) he was definitely addicted to opiates but he had a legitimate need for them and was prescribed them. He however, would also take the lope when he ran out of his pain meds.
His death was not addiction related (from what they could tell).
Right after he passed I become homeless. We were staying with his father at the time until we could save up the money to fix up a cabin on his father's property.

I feel I need to add that I suffer from many chronic illnesses. Because of this, I have never had my license. I also worked my very first job earlier this year. I'm 31.
I always had my husband to depend on for so much. I took care if our two kids and he took care of everything else. That's how he wanted it.

So, as soon as the doctors informed me that he would not make it, I knew I would have no where to live. His father is a terrible person. Without giving o out too many details, I'll just say that my husband was the only reason I didn't turn is father in for sexual harrassment.
So, with my husband gone, I am now broke, no license, no job and, no where to live. I have no family that cares about me apart from an aunt but she has no where for me to stay and only helps me because she knows its what my mom would have wanted.
I also recently found out, that the funeral home that held my husbands memorial is going to petition to become executor of my husbands estate (he had no will) because I haven't been able to pay the entirety of my bill. The purpose of them becoming executor is so they can liquidate any of my husbands assets to pay off the rest of the bill. The worst part is, the only asset my husband had was his truck, which is currently my home. I had made a go-fund-me to help with funeral costs but after they held the memorial, people assumed the bill was paid and stopped donating. I was pretty damned close too.
Not long after I learned my husband wasn't going to make it, I called SAMHSA. I was not sure what help I could get, all I knew was that I needed help. At the time, I told them my main addiction was to opiates. Which wasn't far from the truth. I've never been addicted to meth or things like that although I have had it.
The reason I told them opiates is also the reason for my post today.
I have always been given the strong impression that these types of places do not take loperamide addiction seriously. This is also something my husband used to tell me. He was once one of these people back before he began taking them himself who would say ""you tell them your on shit pills and they're going laugh at you"".

Back in early 2019 I was going to a suboxone clinic. This started after my husband and I attempted to self detox cold turkey for about 7 days. I'll elaborate more on that later. 
Anyways, when I told them I had been taking loperamide, the nurse first asked me why I thought that was an addiction that needed something like suboxone to ""cure"". She then repeatedly tried to tell the doctor ""she's only taking loperamide!"". They constantly downplayed it as something minimal and that I was ""crazy"" for putting my body at risk for something that ""doesn't do much if anything"" for opiate withdrawals. They also accused me of lying about taking so many saying ""that amount would have killed me"". 
Spoiler: it once almost did.
Anyways, I was able to get them to give me the suboxone after I told them I was only taking loperamide when I didn't have pain pills.
The suboxone didn't help though. I absolutely hated it. It made my legs hurt so bad and I constantly felt like shit. 
I had finally gotten to where I only had to visit then clinic once every three weeks, when I discovered a lump on my cervix.
I was diagnosed with cervical and lymphatic cancers shortly after and had to quit suboxone once I found out I needed surgery.
I am happy to say though that after a total hysterectomy and a shit ton of radiation treatments, I am now cancer free. Atleast, I will be 100% sure after I get my final PET scan.

Anyways, back to why I'm here. I have been putting off going to treatment until I could get mine and my husbands affairs in order. I had to find a place to store our stuff and find a place for my for my cat to stay. I also had to wait on his death certificate so I could be put on as executor of his estate and get the truck put in my name. However, after weeks of dodging my questions I learned that the funeral home had been deliberately keeping his death certificate from me until I paid the bill. It didn't matter to them that I made a constant effort to pay them and that I have it all almost paid off. It has gotten to the point however where i can't keep putting off treatment. The anti-diarrhea meds are getting extremely hard to find in stores and I have no money to waste buying them online.
So, I have decided I am going this week. Either Wednesday or Thursday. I just wanted to spend some time with my daughters.
I am getting increasingly afraid though, that they won't take me seriously.
I have gone through a few different types of withdrawls in the past but lope withdrawls are on a whole new level. When my husband and I went through them the week before I decided to go on suboxone. 
Its definitely not like other drugs. Most drug withdrawals can get better over time. Lope however just kept getting worse and worse. I felt worse than I had ever felt in my life. It plunged me into a deep depression and for the first time in many many years, I wanted to kill myself. It gave me extreme suicidal thoughts and i was having vivid dreams of my death. The only thing that helped me through it was my husband. Now he's not with me and I am afraid of what I might do If that happens again. Back when my husband was in the hospital I had to come home for two days. This was after they told me they pretty much knew he wouldn't make it. I had been so focused with staying by his side that I had been out of lope for about 4 days. Withdrawls had begun to kick in full force and all I could think about was ending my life. I was so ready to do it that I wrote my suicide letter, gathered up some important papers with my personal info on them for whoever would find my body. I made a plan to take take all of my husbands psychiatric medications and all of my meds and lay down and hopefully never wake up. I was ready to take them and then the phone rang. It was my youngest daughter (9) and she was worried about me. I talked to her for nearly two hours and decided not to do it just yet. 
The next day my husbands best friend dropped me off some lope. He said he knew I wouldn't be able to get to the store so he had ordered some for me. I took some and decided to hold off on ending my life.

Now I'm terrified that they won't take me seriously and won't help me. 
They've told me that I have to go to detox for 7-10 days before I can go into a residential treatment facility but everyone I have talked to at SAMHSA all say that they won't take me in if I've been clean for more than 3 days and I'm worried about them drug testing me because lope doesn't show up on standard drug tests. It has to be specifically tested for.
So, I am currently, nervously, counting down the days until I leave. I wanted to make this post to get others opinions and advice. I've never been to any type of inpatient treatment before. I'm also wondering if anyone has any opinions on whether or not they'll take me seriously. Its definitely got me nervous. I really need to go into an inpatient treatment center so I can get my life back on track and, so I can have a place to stay.
I have had many resource organizations trying to help me find a place to stay and they can't even find a shelter that will take me. The winter months are coming and I live in West Virginia, so living in a truck in the middle of winter is not a good idea. I was literally told by someone in my local homeless coalition that ""if you were a drug addict you'd get all kinds of help!"". Well surprise, surprise! I guess I'll be putting that to the test.
If anyone has any advice or opinions, I would love to hear them. Also, if any of you have been to an inpatient treatment facility I'd like to know what to expect. I know each place is different bit I'd like to get a general idea of what I'm walking into. Any help right now will be greatly appreciated!


TL;DR: Going into residential treatment soon for a loperamide addiction. I'm worried they won't take me seriously. Don't want to take suboxone or methadone.
I'm currently homeless with no money and can't drive. Just looking for advice or people's opinions. W pi old love to hear your treatment center stories and experiences so maybe I can get a feel for what to expect.",3,0
202,2020-10-11 01:05:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/j8zfez/fuck_trigger_warning/,Fuck (trigger warning ⚠️),"I’m in an outpatient rehab program for addiction and to finally deal with my mental illnesses properly. I self harmed like three nights ago, after drinking and repeatedly watching a triggering movie scene that involved a character cutting herself. I watched it over and over to purposefully trigger myself. Then last night I added more cuts to the group. I hate using knives, they aren’t as efficient as razor blades. I have a shaving razor I could tear apart if I really want to do it. I’m scared for myself because this coming week I’m going to petsit three dogs for 5 days. I’ll be all alone at this house. Alone to drink, smoke weed, and self harm. I want to be responsible and abstain from these unhealthy coping mechanisms and just have a grand time but let’s be real, I’m going to go into self destruct mode. I just need to make sure I’m not in a fog when dealing with the dogs. It’s two big dogs and a small old lady. I’m not worried about handling the lady, Ruby, because she’s so slow from age. However the two other dogs, Harper and Harry, are big and rowdy so I need to have my head when taking care of them. I’ll have to wait to drink and smoke till after I take them out and feed them so they don’t get the best of me and run off. I’m excited to petsit them because I love big dogs and this house is really nice and I’m gonna be sleeping on a tempur-pedic which is a step up from my simple mattress at home. However I’m scared about how much of a bender this will end up being. I have two shifts at my regular job during this petsitting gig, so I’ll probably hit up the dispensary by my work for supplies, and the BevMo right across the street from my work for some light alcohol because I can’t do heavy alcohol. I just remembered, the woman I’m petsitting for said she’s gonna leave some wine for me to have, score! Though I know I shouldn’t drink or smoke, my addiction therapist pointed out that they’re depressants and I’m already depressed as fuck so I’m just digging more of a trench for myself. Honestly I’m scared for my future, it seems so bleak right now. I feel like all I have in life is self harm, pain, and disappointment. I’m, in a way looking, forward to being alone at that house to just relax and also give into my cravings (ramen included because apparently there’s a good vegan ramen place near by). But I’m fear of how far I’ll go into those cravings. Like I’m mostly afraid of how bad the cutting could get. My mom is now apart of my treatment. I signed a waiver to allow her to be in on all aspects of my treatment so I’m afraid that I just gave up the chance to have secrets. I mean I could just lie about my using and cutting but I feel like absolute shit when I lie and I can’t do work properly because I feel heavy sadness when holding a secret and lie. It’s stupid, I know there are people who are great at lying in addiction and my therapist said “If you really wanted to use, then you would”, same with if I really want to give into my vices then I’ll have to be okay with lying. However this rehab I’m in is really good and they could actually possibly help me live a happy life. Fuck, I don’t know how I’m going to live a normal life. I should stop typing. I hope this wasn’t too annoying to read, if anyone did.",7,0

I had asked him to leave my apartment (that he had moved into) 3 weeks ago because I was feeling manipulated by him and he was constantly lying to me. Since that day he claimed to be going back to his Mom’s, but lied and went back to his ex who also uses. I found out because I had a gut feeling and confronted them at her place. She claims that she didn’t know that we were together (she’s also very manipulative), but I know that she was secretly loving the drama. All of sudden this morning I got all these voicemails and messages from my bf saying he feels foolish, and that he’s sorry, and please let’s talk. Well I waited a few hours as I didn’t know what to do, and then I texted him saying that I felt like his ex was manipulating him, and that he needs to walk away, and that it’s time for change, and that I would be willing to speak. Since I sent that message, no news for 12 hours now. His phone is on as I’ve tried to call him.

So now I’m wondering 3 things:

1. Did he mean what he said? But, I was too harsh, so he got overwhelmed and went to use again?
2. Did he die? Overdose? 
3. Was this all a bunch of manipulative bullshit, and he either got tired of waiting for my reply and went to use, or thought my reply required too much work because he doesn’t really want to get better? He was just looking for options on where to stay next?

I was never really a ‘normal’ nicotine user, like I would add sprinkles of American spirit tobacco in my cannabis bowl—for that quick headrush to start off the cannabis high— but I soon swapped to juul and used that daily out of habit. (Plus it honestly really helped with my digestion problems oddly enough..)
 
But when juul had that incident last year of all those ‘mystery lung illnesses’ and had to stop selling them, I found it rather easy to stop using juuls/nicotine. 

I didn’t have any withdrawals like people say. Didn’t get headaches, didn’t get sad, no troubles sleeping. Which i was extremely surprised about since people say quitting nicotine is just as or maybe even more difficult then quitting heroin.. which if that’s true.. WOW it’s such a load of bull they are feeding us. Feeding us this lie of “nicotine is an addictive chemical” .. like that’s just directly putting it in our heads/basically guessing that we will become addicted to it, therefor psychologically we will believe we are addicted ourselves. 
The toughest part of quitting I would say is the habit in my mind it formed. That “time to inhale something other then air”, But was easily replaceable with deep breathing. When I had the ‘craving’, I would replace it with a few deep breaths, which honestly was pretty helpful; replacing habit of juuling with habit of remembering to take a deep breath.

Now I’m not sure if I was addicted to juuling, I’m assuming I was since I didn’t go a day without it for a whole year, using 1 whole pod a day. 
And by no means I would consider myself a ‘mentally strong’ person, I mean I suffer with generalized anxiety & depression for over a decade. (I’m 22) But I do have to admit that it seems like it’s really “all in your head”. If you’re trying to quit, I suggest replacing that habit with a more beneficial & helpful habit. Habits aren’t bad unless they are potentially damaging to you.",2,0

Goodbye career, goodbye car and goodbye to the life I half live now.

I had a counselling session 3 days ago (over the phone due to covid) and this week has been the best week I've had in such a long time. So why am I sitting here at 25 to 3 in the morning On my 7th 0.3g bag after working a 12 hour day yesterday knowing I have to go do it all again in a couple of hours?

Unfortunately, I am in my late 20s (male) and depend on family for financial support. I am trying to find a job and I am also in school part-time, but I do not currently support myself financially.

I need advice on how to deal with my dad (the primary person who supports me). I try and be as submissive as possible to his requests, but he presents these no-win situations and gets really angry when I can't solve them. This is a typical conversation with him.

HIM: OP, your short-term rental is expiring in a few days, where are you going to live after that?

ME: I was hoping you could help find me a room and lend me rent money until I find a job.

HIM: So you want me to just keep paying money even though you're an addict with no credibility?

ME: No, dad. If you don't want to pay, that is fine. I can just live back at home with you until I'm on my feet.

HIM: But if you live with me, you'll be close to your drug dealer. And I don't want an addict in my house!

ME: OK, so what would you like to do?

HIM: I don't know! You come up with an idea.

ME: Dad, the only two possible options are either you pay my rent or you allow me to live with you. The only alternative is that I will be homeless and have to go to a shelter.

HIM: So now you're blackmailing and guilt-tripping me by saying you'll be homeless???

ME: No, I'm not blackmailing you or guilt-tripping you. I'm simply telling you the reality.

HIM: So now I have to throw away my hard-earned money on your rent, knowing you will never hold down a job, watching you ruin everybody's life around you. And if I don't, then I'll have to put up with you being high in my house.

ME: I really do want to be clean and be productive...

HIM: YEAH, RIGHT! 10 FUCKING YEARS I'VE BEEN PUTTING UP WITH YOUR ADDICT BULLSHIT YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! AND YOU WON'T EVEN COME UP WITH A PLAN!

Me: I did come up with a plan. I asked you to pay my rent while I look for a job.

HIM: THAT PLAN WILL NEVER WORK! COME UP WITH A BETTER ONE!

ME: I can live with you at home until I get on my feet.

HIM: THAT WILL NEVER WORK! COME UP WITH A BETTER ONE!

and on and on and on and on...

and of course if I hang up the phone or refuse to continue the argument, he just gets more angry.

&#x200B;

And of course I am always the one who is in the wrong because I am an addict.

And just to clarify, I am not blaming him for being angry. I would be angry too if I were him. I am specifically asking for advice on how to avoid these arguments and maintain my dignity.

And yes, he and the rest of my family would be perfectly justified in putting me out on the street after years of addiction. I am fully aware of that.

The thing is, instead of giving me all my possessions (including my car, which he currently has the keys to), he is always insisting that he wants to help me, he wants to know I am OK, etc. etc. But then whenever it is time to pay for something, he becomes angry and irrational, demanding that I come up with some magical idea that doesn't exist.",2,0

My relationship with father deteriorated worse and worse by the year I haven't spoken to him in almost three years. when my younger brother would get in trouble my old man would take it out on me, and lasted up till the last day I spoke to him.  my brother struggled with soberiety and a few years back got busted cook meth.  My dad called me and I could tell instantly something had happened, my dad couldn't hide his rage.  We eded up getting into big time because he bailed my brother out of jail, I didn't think that was a good idea and I expressed my concerns that they were both codependent.  Needless to say we haven't spoken since.  My brother called me a few months later, with the intention of fixing the issues between me and my father, and told me he stole my guns and pawned them.  Years back he told me that I was so u stable and scary that him and dad decided that they needed to intervene and take all my guns to keep everyone safe.  I believed him.  I thought something was really wrong with me.  As a result of the loss of self worth my addiction really began to downward spiralI.  I also began to develop some serious hate for my father.  I compenplated actually murdering my father.  One time I ended up at his house at night with a pistol and I was going gonna put a bullet in him while he was asleep.  By this point I had such bad ptsd even just being around my dad it would go off.  I was so mad.  All the abuse as a child, constant fighting with my dad.  Social rejection. Drug use.  It had all taken a serious toll on my mental well being.  I lost a job because of my anger.  Eventually I met my wife.  began recovery around 30, struggled for a few years but I have stayed clean for over five years now.  

After hearing that my brother did that all those feelings of worthlessness and feelings of self-destruction began to resurface.  I continued treatment and I have mangetto stay clean but I really hurt from that.  I wish he wouldn't have told me.  I honestly don't understand why he did.

He promised he would pay for them to make it up.  Of course nothing came of it.  One year later he came home for Christmas with his own family, he didn't call or say anything, and I fucking lost it. I was triggered like I had never been triggered before.  I was pissed he had not made good on his word and that he had actually not even spoken to me since he told me what he did and that he would pay for it  The betrayal I felt was uncontrollable and I made sure he knew that.  I broke off communication with my mom and my sister after explaining why I was upset with my brother, they told me they wouldn't get involved. I told my mom that I didn't want to have any thing to do with them if they were going to continue to support my brothers behavior's and continue to pay for him to do everything. 

really just wanted to be included and be made to felt like my feelings mattered. 

I know I need to move on and get over it.  But I really fucking hate him.  I don't respect his sobriety, I think he is just going through the motions to keep out of trouble and I am worried about the next time he gets in trouble that my parents will dip into their retirement to fix his bullshit.

I sent him a text today.  It had been almost a year since the holiday fight.  I shouldn't have said anything but all I wrote was

 It's been about another year.  I'm still waiting for compensation for those guns you stole.  

All I accomplished was getting myself pissed off and hurt my feelings and say more things I shouldn't have, regardless of his treatment towards me. 

I just don't know.  I want to have relationship with him. I need him to understand how his actions continue to facilitate a cycle of worthlessness

He recently (past year maybe) has been using weed everyday, and alcohol pretty frequently. I'm not sure how much alcohol, because he sometimes secretly buys nips at the store and day drinks.

I have noticed a personality change in him since we met. He's definitely less sweet, less considerate, less organized, less motivated, and more irritable among other things. 

His family drinks a lot. At least twice a week, and they binge drink on weekends. When he drinks, he usually has no limit and blacks out, makes messes, and argues. 

I have tried to bring up his drinking/smoking but he argues with me because I had pretty severe addiction issues in the past. Especially in my early-mid 20's (I'm 30). So, he says that his behavior is normal. 

Also, my dad is an alcoholic/crack cocaine addict. So, sometimes having to take care of my partner, taking his keys so he won't drive, hiding alcohol, and finding him randomly wasted, is pretty triggering for me. My mom has always told me, ""Never get into a relationship with an addict.""

The last time I used was 2 months ago I thought I was gonna die. My heart, I couldn't breathe. I cried that day to my husband saying how I dont want to use again. I dont know when to stop and I'm scared I will kill myself by accident. I use that day as a reminder to keep me away from it. 

I love stimulants..  my family loves stimulants. My mom and my sister use aderall. My mom is hooked. You wouldn't even suspect shes an addict she functioning member of society. Its always around me being offered to me. And it helps me get through tasks and my job with the motivation I lack. And  that's why I get addicted because I tell myself ok it's not as bad as blow.

I have stopped doing blow but now I'm doing aderall 3 times a week...which is not a lot to people who are popping it everyday but to me it's a failure. I used to use aderall everyday plus cocaine occasionally to get through my demanding job. I'm relapsing and it made crave blow so bad the other day. I communicated to my husband as to why I was frustrated ""I'm not gonna get it, but I want it"" and I thank the universe that I can do this and that I have someone who helps me stay clean from it. We've done this a few times we switch roles at times as to who stands their ground. Than someone gives in sometimes after staying clean for 6 months 

We never got to the point of using everyday but we did like twice a week and we would do a few grams when we did.

 I'm writing today because yesterday I took around 80mgs of aderall (which I stole from my sister cuz I just had to have it) fucking weak, and I thought my heart was gonna burst. I haven't slept... I still cant sleep. I didn't eat at all yesterday, i forced two spoons of ground Turkey before bed just to have something. It fucked up my stomach, my head hurts and my chest feels so weak.

I've explained to my sister that I have a problem and she keeps offering me and then I need more and more. I'm not blaming her for giving in. I'm just being weak. 

She doesnt understand addiction, she doesnt see me  as an addict because I have my life ""together""

I've spoken to my friends I used with the most that I can't hang out with them if they are using or trying to get me to use. They have been great and we've all stayed clean together and I'm really proud of all of us  for pulling through this far. 

I hope today's realization that I have a problem no matter what drug I use encourages me to stay clean.

I never thought I had a problem I always thought I was in control and I didn't understand how people could have drug addictions. I mean I was always used but I ""wasn't addicted""

Ha! It sneaks up on you. 

I've learned a few things

I like stimulants because it motivates me at work and getting work done at home and I get a lot done when I use.

I've learned the reason I lack motivation is because I'm not happy with my job and the insane hours i was working drained me.

I changed jobs to a lower paying job but I get a few days off a week and its given me the motivation I seeked from using drugs.

Recently I started using aderall because we lack staff and I've had to work every single day some days doing 12hr shifts.

My new job offered me a higher paying position but I declined knowing this is what started it all. Working all day everyday...not worth my mental health. So they hired someone I previously worked WITH that I despise due to stealing money among many other tr hinges. This person took the position I declined and became my boss. Fml.

I've realized the HOSPITALITY industry drains me and it's not the best thing for me and my triggers. I've taken this new found motivation to start a side business so I can work from home some days out of the week so i dont have to work 5, 6 days at a restaurant. 

My goal is to have my side business become a full time occupation where I can make as much as I'm making right now that I'm working for someone else.

I dont know what I'm expecting to get out of this...but It helps me organize and pin point how to tackle this mess I've made.",3,0

I bought a joint today before work, smoked it after work on my way to get groceries. I got scared because I’ve had to stop smoking every day so my tolerance went down and I smoked the whole joint and so I was high as titties. Then on the way home, I planned on getting a can of angry orchard at 7-11 but apparently the one by me doesn’t sell them so I went to the liquor store across the street and they didn’t have it either but I really wanted to get drunk tonight so I got a mikes harder watermelon. It’s my first time trying this brand and flavor and I hate it but I gotta chug it because it was like $4 and I’m not ~rich~. I still live with my mom and we have a one bedroom apartment and I sleep in the living room. It’s a nice set up with a wonderful bed and all that shit. Anyways I waited till my mom just went to bed so I could open the can up. Now I’m watching 28 days and drinking this gross drink. I had the goal of getting drunk tonight with this movie so that’s why I feel like I have to fight to get through this drink. “The whole point of the game is to minimize the pain” that’s from 28 days. It’s so damn true. I feel so much pain and I just want it to end but I can’t kill myself. My grandma killed herself last year so I can’t do that to my family, so I self medicate and try to lessen the pain. The pain is unimaginable with the suicide of my grandma. She was the first person to hold me because my mom had her in the delivery room. I can’t believe she did it. I just got to the scene where the roommate cuts herself. I want to cut but I really shouldn’t, I can’t hide it. I got a tattoo on the area I usually cut on and so I feel off doing it somewhere else. I will say, this bigger can of mikes harder definitely is enough to get me feeling drunk. So far I don’t feel overly drunk but we’ll see how the whole thing affects me because I have a few more gulps to go. I want to cut so badly. I keep watching the self harm scene over and over. I was hospitalized for suicide once and I self harmed in the hospital and was put into the more severe ward and it was really scary. I don’t want to be there ever again. Never again. I will never allow myself to be checked into a mental ward ever again. I have my first therapy session with an addiction therapist tomorrow morning. I’m in an intensive outpatient rehab by the way. Fuck I really wish I could be more intoxicated. I just finished the alcohol I got. I hate that the 7-11 near me doesn’t sell alcohol. It’s fine, there’s a liquor store that’s even closer to me.

I 25(m) recently moved into an apartment with some empty bedrooms in a new city. Halfway through September the landlord moved in a girl the same  age as me. There was weirdness and issues from the first night. We had some drinks and it turns out she’s a recovering alcoholic that just recently got out of rehab. She told me about some trauma she’s experienced and how a few months ago she got out of a bad abusive relationship.

Third night she got drunk and trashed our apartment. I begged her to go to bed but she wouldn’t she yelled and swore at me and was angry with me.

She’s the sweetest person on earth when she’s sober. So shy, so skittish, dead silent at all times of day and night.

The second weekend she disappeared for two days and her cell phone was disconnected. I called the police because I was afraid something had happened to her. She acts really when she drinks and sometimes disappears randomly with no explanation. I found a note in her room she had written saying she thinks her ex boyfriend sent someone to murder her. She ended up coming home a few hours later and it turns out she was at work for a temp agency the whole time.

Two nights later she got drunk and was angry. She shoved me into a wall and punched me. She yelled and swore at me a lot. I spent four hours trying to get her to call down and ended up spoon feeding her in bed like a toddler until she passed out. Finally went to bed around 1 am and overslept for work.

I have a long history of abuse and trauma and substance abuse myself. I’ve been physically, sexually, emotionally, abused by women A LOT. I told her the next morning I wouldn’t stand for her abuse and that if anything like that happens again she will have to leave. She was so remorseful. She’s always remorseful. She just has an extremely hard time regulating her desire to drink and do drugs. When she’s on drugs she’s antisocial but not mean. When she’s drunk she becomes an explosive ball of irate uncontrollable emotion.

Both my parents are alcoholics and I’ve had to abandon them. I am an alcoholic too but not as bad as the three of them.

I try to give her plenty of space. We usually talk for a bit at least once a day.

The problem is that I find myself falling deeply and passionately in love with her. I don’t understand it. Her presence makes me feel extremely emotional. We’ve cuddled very briefly about three times. She says she doesn’t really want to because she’s afraid it will turn sexual and ruin our living arrangement. I can’t help but feel that she’s already done everything that can ruin it.. we talk almost daily about whether or not she needs to move out.

I asked her if I could take her out for dinner next week when I get paid and she said yes.

When I look her in the eyes I see myself in a dark mirror. I see my past. I see my mom. I see my exes. I see my friends I couldn’t save in the past.

She’s so poor. I give her money sometimes to go pick up food for us to share. I gave her 40$ to hook her phone up so I wouldn’t have to worry about her all the time.

I make really good money so this isn’t an issue, but don’t want her to take advantage of or become dependent on me. She’s pretty respectful of it and always offers to pay me back someday but I’m just happy her health is looked after. She’s so sad. All she does is lie in bed 24/7 and cry off and on. I give her a hug sometimes. She never shows up to work even when she says she will. I just feel like she needs to someone to believe in her and be patient with her while she tries to get herself and her health together.

I’ve only known her 3 weeks but we’ve become really tied up in each others lives. Or maybe I just have in her’s...


I find myself becoming irresistibly drawn to her. I think about the feeling of holding her nonstop.

I also work from home so we basically are together 24/7. Though she mostly just stays in her room. But she never closes her door which I don’t understand... even when she sleeps. Most people who want privacy keep their door closed.",1,0

I over dose on my medication and OTC medication because the prescribed dosage doesn’t work. I don’t discuss what I do  with my doctor because he won’t treat me if I take more than I’m prescribed. I actually stopped going to doctors in general because of it. 

I stopped taking my medication when It stopped working. I was told by a few doctors that I couldn’t go higher on what I was prescribed since I had reached the max. There was no point to figure out on my own what the correct dosage was, if I was never going to get it prescribed. Taking over 100mg of prozac on my own could be doing more damage to my brain than good especially when mixed with other medications. 

I haven’t discussed any of this  with my doctor about stopping, or switching medications. I just stopped on my own. The reasons to be on medication went away once I was put out of a bad environment. 

I want to start medication again but I know I’ll abuse it, so I haven’t called a doctor yet. I do feel depressed especially about my future and I’d like to be happy. 

How do I give up control of my need to “be my own psychiatrist” and let the professional handle things even when I’m not getting better and there is a disagreement on the correct treatment. 

Basically, how do I stop turning my psychiatrist into my drug dealer?

i get high every night. its just a matter of when in the night it happens.

at the moment its 6pm, and im not high. at noon and sober, i said ""i wont smoke tonight"" but here i am, thinking ""man, there is another probably 8hrs before I fall asleep wtf am i gunna do?

the no negative side effects dont include ""bad for your lungs"" but like, its not financially impactful, doesnt effect relationships in my life, im not calling in sick the next day because of it...so like why quit? which leads to not quitting.

the only ""bad thing"" is if i dont see any reason not to smoke, and something happens that makes it so i cant, i get a little upset, but Id say thats no different than you having plans with friends you were looking forward to, and having them cancelled...you're ""a bit"" upset.


any tips/tricks/tools to help me quit?

long time since I posted here but I need you guys again. 

Sorry of the title sounds more dramatic than it is, I got out of a 6-year long mixed drug addiction 1.8 year ago - ish. Now I’ve got some pills to help me get rid of my nicotine addiction, thats the last drug I haven’t kicked yet and I’m so scared.

For me drugs are a promise that however my day may go I always have something that will be good about it in the end of the day, some beauty in the end of the tunnel, before it was weed, benzo, speed or whatever I had in my pocket. Now it’s been cigarettes and when I quit them I have nothing.

It feels like being left in the dark with no flashlight and I don’t know what to do. I know it’s just a need that doesn’t exist and that cigarettes doesn’t make me happy for real - that’s it’s all in my head. But this will be the first time as an adult to face life without anything to support myself on and it’s really terrifying. 

How do you guys do without drugs to rely on? How are you not scared all the time? 

Sorry for my ramblings and if I’m incoherent. This is a bad day.",1,0

the problem is that i have more of a mental addiction than a physical one to alcohol and opioids. i say this because they only last for about 2-3 months then they go away and i go about my life. now i will admit that pills were the first thing i got hooked on so i do have cravings in between these episodes but theyre easier to turn down. anyway, its like they take turns on which addiction it will be for that episode. usually its alcohol because its much easier to obtain but i recently had surgery so i had access to the pain pills,  which also was the trigger for the current situation. 
i have never really addressed or treated any addictions because i have always succumbed to the impulses. and on top of that, i haven’t told anyone except my therapist and one friend about what has been going on & my history with it. my entire family and friends otherwise have no idea that i have any sort of addiction. and even worse, my family has negative opinions on addicts so i play along and condemn them knowing that im one of them. thats why its so hard to tell anyone and i am so scared to say anything. which also means i am terrified to go to a rehab because my secret would be known. 
i would need to go to an impatient because i know that im actually crazy underneath it all and also completely manipulative and would do anything i could to get my fix. 
i guess im just asking for opinions because im so scared to do anything until i think about the pros and cons but my mind will always think of more cons and the internet is a beautifully anonymous place so i thought why not.",5,0
246,2020-10-07 13:34:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/j6vbbm/weed_addiction/,Weed addiction.,"Hello, 

I'm 32 and I have been smoking marijuana since I was 13. 

Since my brother in-law passed away my consumption reached another level, as I can easily smoke my way through 7grams on a daily basis. 

I spend on average £500 a month to service my habbit and what's worse is I've now started drinking too. I think probably around 8 pints a night. 


Anyway last week I decided to go cold turkey whilst on a break in Cornwall. 

I have never felt so shit, I'm already suffering with depression but I genuinely feel like killing myself. 

I'm not sure how I can do life without drugs being apart of it, and the truth is I'm not a big fan of perseverance. I don't have any. 

I was abused as a child and so that's why I smoke, it's always been a coping mechanism and almost like a best friend, without it I'm not sure I would even be here. 

But my consumption has taken over. My chest is fucked, I cough and it sounds like a car back firing. 

I don't know what to do with myself. I know I entitled the post as addition, but this is as much about depression as it is addiction. 

I've tried taken medication for my anxiety and depression but whatever I take, seems to send me up the wall. It intensifies my unpredictability and means I am way more likely to hurt myself.

I'm fed up, I'm tired and I feel lost. 

Beachy head is in my too Google searches but truthfully I don't have the balls to take the trip. 

I almost succeeded in an overdose when I was 16, I had my stomach pumped and the fear of suffering is what stops me from trying again. The truth is I hate physical pain. 

Is there anyone else who feels the same? In the same boat? Thinks the same? 

Just knowing that I'm not alone would be nice. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I went from an occasional and careful user of recreational drugs to routine benzo use after a particularly bad year, where I was assaulted, lost my friends and found out my loved one was dying. I went from half a Xanax before bed to 10-15 2mg xans every day. I’d wake up with my head bleeding and no memories, I’d lie to my friends and boyfriend about having been high even though I rang them completely unintelligible then forgot. The first time I went into withdrawal cold turkey, within hours I was shaking, clammy and erratic. I got through the withdrawal but wasn’t prepared for a life without drugs. I relapsed, repeat. 

The final time I went into withdrawal, I had seizures even on replacement diazepam. I lost the sensation in my fingertips, was paranoid, photophobic and couldn’t string a thought together in my head. I was taken to hospital in an ambulance and discharged myself, although I only remember snippets of this. I spent that initial 2 weeks in my flat alone, blinds down, not sleeping. I worried that I’d die from seizures and no one would find me. I went to NA but it wasn’t my scene, no one really understood benzo withdrawal, and just made comments on my age. I realised if I don’t fix this, I’ll be dead in a year, whether from Xanax contaminated with fentanyl or suicide. I got through that initial physical withdrawal and fought through the emotionally numb and sleepless depression of the ‘psychological withdrawal’. I struggled through the weeks where I couldn’t go 15 seconds without thinking ‘I need a Xanax’. I carried on, I went to therapy. I made friends and I graduated with a first class degree. Now I’m one of the best universities in the world for my masters. Two years has gone by and honestly, I do not ever crave or even want a Xanax. I sleep just fine now. 

Reflecting on it all, I’m proud of myself but also shocked. I volunteered at a centre for homeless women and of those who were Iv heroin users, they expressed surprise that I was an addict and it was benzos. They said benzos were harder to come off than crack or heroin, they told me stories about friends who had died from street vallies and xans contaminated with opioids. I guess for people like me who were addicted to counterfeit versions of prescribed drugs, it’s easy to separate yourself, an ‘addict’ from ‘junkies’. In reality, it’s the same thing, same disease, same brutality. 

I am proud, I am grateful. If you’re new to recovery and struggling with ‘is this ever going to get any easier?’ It will. It’s gonna be really bad for a while but it will improve, you won’t suffer forever and it’ll be worth it. I am grateful not to miss another second of my life.",69,0

This last bout has lasted over a year and a half, daily use. My ex and I, four years together, split up last year, and once again my addiction whole heartedly took over my life harder than it ever has before. I became homeless for 8 months, but have been in a home for the past four months. I live alone. 

Every hour of every day is spent thinking about meth, doing meth, making sure I have enough meth, selling something to get meth, and overall contemplating just how miserable my life currently is. I wish for death frequently, but I am unable to take my life because I am not religious, and the nothingness I believe comes after scares me too greatly. So I simply suffer alive. 

My use has become very heavy recently. For the past couple months, because of tolerance, and because I was financially able, I’ve gone through an ounce (28 grams) every two weeks. I usually run out before the two weeks has ended. I shoot almost half a gram at at a time, multiple times during the day. It simply brings me back to a level of medium now. The rush is short, and it has become simply a means to escape the horrific depression that greats me when I have nothing in my system from sobriety. 

That is what keeps me from sobriety. Three days after a last use, I wake up into a different reality. Sadness, blandness, depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, hopelessness. Stereotypical withdraw. And all instantly cured by another use. I feel completely useless in the fight against it. I have tried countless times over the last nine years. I am afraid I am not strong enough. It is too easy to escape. 

I have finally gotten rid of all my stuff though. It is thrown away, and I financially am unable to purchase a single point for another week and a half. I have nothing left to sell, but you know how that goes. I’m sure I can find something or find someway if desperate enough. 

Which is why I’m asking for advice. I have nothing planned for the next two weeks besides make it two weeks into sobriety. I am trying to hole myself in and leave as infrequently as I can. The longest I’ve made it this year without a stimulant, specifically meth is 11 days. Other than that, three days at most. I really would like to make it 14 days, for myself. 30, even better. But I’m trying to remain realistic. 

What are some mental tricks I can use when the depression sets in? What are good ways to distract myself? 

How did you do it in your personal experience, when it had gotten as bad as it has for me?

Anything can help. 

If anything wish me luck please. I’m starting to finally lose my name to this addiction, something I never thought would truly happen. But I am changing. And I hate it. 

Have a good night everyone.",56,0

For me, it's always felt good, I haven't experienced negative side effects, I haven't felt like I needed more afterwards. But I guess she was different, bec she apparently decided to keep doing it. I know I remember at least one time a few weeks after the first time she asked me to do it again and I didn't want to, then I don't think I heard anything from her about it for a few months when we did it together again, at the time she still seemed normal, despite knowing she had done it a few times without me as well, I didn't pick up on anything that made me think she had any issues with going on. We've dabbled in a few drugs together and she always went a little farther than me, like we tried coke, I just did it the one time but she would always do a little more, like just a cocaine week or whatever, so I figured that's all it was with her doing meth a few more times than me. 

The 2nd time was in July, I haven't seen much of between now and then but when I did she was always really quiet and would be like testy and not in a great mood. Idk if that had anything to do with a developing drug problem or if she was going th something emotional that may have contributed to her turning towards meth more. But fast forward to yesterday, I hadn't seen her in like a month, she had visibly lost weight, she's still a healthy weight but definitely smaller, her weight tends to fluctuate tho so I didn't think much of it. There was no plan to do meth, but she invited me to spend the night at her place, I thought we'd just smoke weed, but when we get there she pulls out the meth, I guess I just thought sure why not, should be fun. But after we took it I noticed how strange she got like, compared to when we did it before, it was affecting her more than me (she may have been doing much bigger lines than me), like she would be like totally blanked face, and she kept like moving her jaw over making her face look droopy. Like she was just trying to snap her jaw which is normal on meth, but like she just held it like that. And we had plans to watch a bunch of stuff and all this and the entire time, for like 18 hours we hung out, she just kept the tv on youtube and she just selected a song and paused it and would go find another song and pause it. And like I could barely get her to say a word to me, it was just really bizarre, and not at all how she was acting the last time I saw her do it. So all that, plus noticing she bought in a much larger quantity than in the past made me sure this is or is becoming a regular thing for her to do.

I did notice a big red flag before the meth became part of the night, that her apartment is absolutely filthy, and I initially figured it was a mental illness thing. I guess that's an important factor too is that she's bipolar and tells me she has another diagnosis that she doesn't want to share with anyone. I don't know if she stays on her meds. I imagine her mental health failing led her to self medicate with drugs, but the drugs are probably just making her mental illness worse. Does anyone have any advice, I really have no idea how to approach this. She gets really sensitive and upset about being called out on things, I'm scared if I confront her about it she'll just get upset and push me out so I can't even try to help anymore and it'll just push her farther into it. I don't really know anyone else I can ask to help me, she has a small group of friends that I don't really know at all and that frankly probably aren't good people for her to be around. I know her parents are in the area but I have no idea how to get in contact with them. So please, any advice or anything is so appreciated

my name is Christopher, and I have a severe addiction problem.

this is… (Chris lowers his head to the floor,) I can't… I...

this is going to sound so stupid! I don't even know why am posting this. Especially considering that most of you up here probably are not professionals.

I am now 38 years old, will be 39 this next month of November. ever since I was in the fifth grade, age 11, I have been struggling with this.

basically, at age 11, I was introduced to the television show full House. (Not to be confused with the newer Netflix series).

at first, it was OK. I watched for entertainment, and really enjoyed the show. then however, as things progressed, it got much worse. I begin binging whenever I could on pre-recorded episodes. I started skipping lunch and dinner at the kitchen table with my family, but instead locked myself in my bedroom with my television and VCR. if I did not watch at least one episode a day, I practically went ballistic.

I think, I first knew we had a major problem when I was about 12, and had a major blowup argument with my mother. I don't remember what it was regarding, but there was something I wanted to do that she would not allow. all of a sudden, totally at random out of nowhere, I remember slamming my hand down as hard as I could on the kitchen table turning to her, and saying you're not my mother, if Pam Tanner was still alive, or if Danny Tanner was my dad, this would not be happening. obviously, my mother stood there completely dumbfounded, like, WTF?

it's a really long story, but essentially, growing up, watching full house has been my getaway. The Tanner family is basically the family I never had and always wanted. obviously, being it is an acting television show, I can't be a part of it, so the closest I can do is to continue binging and watching. of course, then afterword, I feel like total shit. at this time, going even just one day sober without watching the show is impossible.

I have become a person in my head of two personalities. The real Christopher, which is myself, and then, the Christopher I want to be living with the entire cast permanently.

if for any reason I am unable for a day to watch at least one episode, then, I do my best to resort to drinking. i'm not an alcoholic, and have not become intoxicated on alcohol… Yet… But that's the point. I feel like at the rate I am spiraling out of control, the potential is there.

I have always blamed things on OCD, just simply being a huge fanatic of the show, what's wrong with that, trying to find that key element which I can relate to, and just somehow mysteriously became attached to this particular show.

I can't keep doing this! I can't keep fighting and resisting the truth, living in this lie. i'm hurting myself, and I'm hurting my family! my family is not the most supportive of me getting help. One minute, they say they are, but the next, not so much.

I am totally blind, and have been since birth, therefore, I cannot drive. I do not feel comfortable being in the car with Uber or with Lyft, as I don't know the drivers from Adam, and with this pandemic, I have no way of knowing if they have the virus, or have had another passenger in their vehicle who did have it. so getting to any type of meeting in person or any type of support group is darn near impossible. that however said, I am willing to take that risk. if that's what it's going to take to get me sober, and back on the right path, I'll do it. I don't make much money, so transportation payments might be an issue, but… See what I mean…? There I go again trying to make any excuse I can. This is got to stop!

Chris lowers his head with tears streaming down my face. guys, I need help. I want help! you have no idea how frightening/terrifying it has been for me subscribing to the sub Reddit, let alone posting this discussion. I don't know what to do, as I have tried going to counselors, doctors, etc. I've never been ready however to talk about the real situation. This is not OCD, this is not me being a fanatic. This is a problem. I have a problem. I have an addiction. i'm told that acknowledging the addiction is the first step, to stop living in denial like I have been doing for the past nearly 30 years. i'm just hoping that somebody can offer me some encouragement, and perhaps some resources. I live in Indian land South Carolina. i'd rather not give any more identifiable information than this, but if anyone can find some resources in my general area that might help, again, transportation is going to be an issue. I don't know how we're going to make this work, but, if you all are willing to work with me, I'm willing to meet you guys halfway. i'm placing my right hand over my heart. I, Christopher, and making a commitment to get any help that I possibly can to overcome this addiction once and for all. further, I pledge to commit to any treatment program or any type of help which I may receive, in full cooperation. I don't know, I'm not sure what to do, at this point, I am throwing my hands in the air virtually. I surrender. Please help me. this addiction is ruining my life, and it's taking every ounce of quality away from my life. i'm living in a fantasy world, or rather, as I like to say, I am living in a bubble.",3,2

I just want enough to feel not depressed, even though alcohol is a depressant but we’re gonna just ignore that. I worry that the outpatient program I’m in will drop me as a patient if I tell them how much I’ve been disregarding my goal of sobriety. I don’t want to lie to them though because what’s the point of going through that insurance money if I’m not going to be honest. But also my addiction wants me to lie so I can fake it all the way through and please my mom enough to move on and leave me to self medicate. BUT I kinda want to live a good and happy life and I know alcohol/drugs won’t get me there, if anything it will hold me back for an unseeable amount of time or possibly forever. Fuck, like I know this truth but still I plan to use tomorrow and the next day and probably the next. I wish cannabis was cheaper. I’ll only have $74 to spend on cannabis and alcohol, gotta stretch that out for as long as possible. Thank goodness for calfresh, I don’t have to worry about feeding myself. I can’t believe I eat so much now and so freely, I’ve been addicted to hunger since middle school (22now) and now I’m at a really healthy weight. I swapped one addiction for the other though so while my physical health is better than ever, my mental health is still absolute shit. I gotta face and heal from my traumas. I had a realization tonight when talking to my best friend about my trauma, I hold onto the horrible memories in a self destructive way. I let them rule my life, fueling my various addictions and holding me back from trusting fully in the world and my life journey. I’m so scared of getting hurt again, even though I know logically that I can’t live a life pain free. I know that life is full of beautiful moments as well as painful ones but I’m so scared I’m going to break if another tragedy or trauma comes my way. My grandma committed suicide last November. We’re almost to the one year mark since we lost her. It hurts so much. I can’t believe she did it. I can’t believe she did it. I want the pain of my grandma’s suicide to just go away. It hurts my heart too much. I’ve been high every day since that horrible horrible day. I wish I could be high now. It’s been about 10 days since I used cannabis. I just want to stop feeling pain. I want the heartache to chill the fuck out. I want to feel nothing or pure happiness, but not this pain. Not anymore. I should go to sleep. Thanks for reading this if you did. I’m sorry if I made you sad or triggered anything, let me know if I did so I can be more cautious with my future posts. Take care loves.",1,0

The past couple of years I've begun to hear less and less from her. We usually communicate through Facebook messenger since she has limited resources; she's most likely homeless right now. I can't help her, we don't live in the same city. From what I've been told she is homeless, likely a drug addict, and also has mental health issues. She's no longer the same person she once was. I noticed a difference in the way she types from years priors to now. Her typing is incoherent, full of spelling mistakes as if she lost the ability to communicate properly. Her family wants nothing to do with her, and I have no means of supporting her myself.

She's suffering out there, alone.  Sometimes the image of her sleeping on the side of the street pops up in my head. It may or may not be the case, but I can only wonder.

Anyways, I'm just writing this to put it out there.",3,0

I have a history of cocaine addiction but have been sober since leaving my ex. My ex was both physically and emotionally abusive, and I carry alot of trauma from the three years I spent with him. It's been about six months since I left him and I recently met this guy who I really like, we've hung out a couple times and I did briefly tell him about my past because I know it's important that I kind of warn people. He's really nice and sweet, and we have alot of fun together. The only catch is that the majority of the nights we hang out together, we are getting drunk, going to the bar, etc. This didn't appear to be an issue until the last time we hung out. We get drunk, walk to the bar as usual, I'm definitely already a little tipsy, meet some girl at the bar, she follows me into the bathroom, next thing I know she's scooping coke into my nose. I immediately feel like dogshit, go outside to tell this guy and he says 'lets go home'. Me being on coke, we stay at the bar anyways and end up bringing the girl and her bf home to my place to hang out. By this point I'm pretty much blacked out and I don't remember much of the rest of the night until they leave and he says to me 'I'm gonna leave too'. I ask why and he says I've been mean to him all night and so I told him to just leave and I push him, pretty hard. He immediately goes to leave, I follow him out crying, apologizing profusely, and he agrees to stay just to sleep. He leaves the next morning, says he's not mad. Obviously he's upset, I text him saying I'm so sorry and I know he feels some type of way about it and I'm just gonna give him some space. This was a week ago and I haven't heard from him since.

There are some obvious points to be made here. 1) I clearly have an issue with alcohol just as much, and I've realized this. I haven't drank since, I'm making an honest effort to tackle my alcoholism and stay sober. 2) It was naive of me to think that I could have a casual relationship with someone who drinks heavily and not have my own issues come to surface. It was stupid of me to think I could drink at a bar all night and say no to someone who offers me cocaine.

But the worst part is that I physically pushed this guy. I do not have a history of hurting people like this (except for my ex in self defense), but when he said he was going to leave I felt abandoned. I was drunk, angry with myself, and pushed him. I felt like I was back in that apartment I used to share with my ex, him pumping drugs and alcohol into my system, beating me every night when we got home, and then leaving me to go to another party. But this guy wasn't my ex, he's done nothing wrong to me, he was actually pretty concerned when I told him I did coke in the bathroom and I brushed it off and then proceeded to take my disappointment in myself out on him all night until I literally pushed him. How am I any different than my ex?

I feel pretty fucked up about all of this and I don't know what to do. I know I should stop drinking, I know I should probably stay away from romantic/sexual relationships for a while, but I just want to explain to him. I just want to see him again and know that he doesn't think I'm a terrible person. But there's nothing I can do to take it back, salvage our relationship, or make what I did excusable. What I did was inexcusable and wrong, regardless of the context. I just want to text him, but I know I shouldn't. What do I do?",2,0

(In need of some motivation),"After thinking a lot of times that I had my breakthrough moment, I feel lost and honestly need to hear stories about people actually breaking through. After having so many supposed breakthrough moments I feel unmotivated whenever I want to change my lifestyle. Instantly the thoughts pop into my mind, demoralizing me to the point of seeing suicide as the only exit to my addiction. I've gone to rehab twice for a total of 7 months because I was so motivated and certain I was going to stop using. Long story short, I relapsed the same week I got home and started using daily. Now whenever I feel like actively changing my lifestyle I just think to myself; if going to rehab twice won't help you you're a lost cause. The only things I've managed to overcome are my use of alcohol (though I didn't drink a lot, just daily) and hard drugs like speed, XTC, MDMA etc. My addiction to marihuana is simply too strong and way harder to overcome (personally) than any other substance. It might not be the most physically damaging, but mentally it has destroyed me. Anyway sorry for the long post, thanks for reading.",2,0

For as long as I could remember, I have spent most of my free time on the internet, whether it be youtube, video games, porn or light novels. Up until high shcool, this had bot been a real issue, as I did not have many responsibilities until it started, however, afterwards, it was kind of a crapshow, at least for me.

Right now, I am a senior and am about to submit my college applications in a mont or so, however I already know that I have not even been performing close to my potential for the last 4 years. All around me, I see people who have spoken on global issues on the international stage, people who have opened their own companies, people who have learned math and physics to the graduate level and many more. Since this is the case, it hurts me even more to know that I am unable to do something even so simple as do my daily homework. 

For the last 4 years, but especially this year, I have felt that I have an almost unbelivable level of demotivation about pursuing the things I care about and the things that are implrtant in the short term. What is even worse for my mental state is that I can not even blame anything but myself for this, as I have a set of very supporting parents, no financial problems, a healthy friend circle and a seemingly bright future ahead of me. Even though I am very thankful for all of these things, they just serve to remind me that all my problems are soley coused by myself, and even if the solution seems so easy when looking from the outside, I just cant seem to do really antthing productive for an extended oeriod of time.

This becomes especially prevelent when I watch any videos on youtube or do anything on my phone or computer at all. I have tried almost everything on the internet to get rid of this addiction, meditation, schedules, alarms, accontibility buddies, locking, dopamine clenses, you say it, I tried it, and nobe od them worked. This past summer was especially horrible, as I finally had the time to get back to square one and catch ho with everyone else, and maybe get ahead on my schoolwork. However, what did I do? Youtube/games/lightnovels. For three months. THREE MONTHS. Every. Single. Day. Almost 14 hours a day on average. Of course, not even considering catching up, I did not even start any of my summer homeworks, which led to me falling further behind. For the last 2 months, I have been on my phone almost constantly, even during snd after online classes, which leads to me falling further and further into this hole I can not climp out of.

I realise that this a comparitively soft kind of addiction relative to what some of the redditors on this sub have, and everyone her has all my prayers, I can not even imagine what some of you guys are going through. However, I am truthfully scared that I will be like this for the rest of my life, bareky scraping by on the ground and not even showing 1/10th of my potential. I would appritiate all the help and advice you guys could give, and thank you for reading my post!

But he keeps on saying he’s detoxing at home and he doesn’t wanna be in any sort of hospital or Rehab Center. He makes excuses and a ton of other things.

Since we already have experienced his manipulation, we are not giving him a chance to do that again. We are countering every excuse he makes and we are trying to force him to come to a conclusion. Either to continue doing drugs away from us or to request for help.

I don’t think he is aware that what he is facing is addiction and not depression. He keeps on saying he is depressed, but that is because of the constant thought of Using again.

And keeps on mentioning stuff about being able to control himself, stop whenever he wants and uses whenever he wants. (Which again contradicts the definition of addiction)

He also keeps on saying the meds we give him aren’t working or that the real meds he needs are Benzos. Which we know that is simply an excuse for him to use them again.

We are literally countering every single excuse he makes up, Idk whether that is a good approach or not because trying with sympathy and empathy failed, he uses that against us. He probably thinks to himself (Ok I can use them, and whenever things get bad with tolerance or whatever I’ll just use my family to help me get treatment)

We are trying to convince him that he has an issue, and we keep on addressing it so that even if he uses, he still won’t feel happy or relaxed, cuz it will always be on his thoughts (our words).

So far it isn’t doing as much as we expected, but we genuinely need to find a way to convince him that he needs Rehab",0,0

Rectal NAD does not even hold a candle to Intramuscular infusions/ injections... N-Riboside while appearing to have some effects is also equally inept by comparison to IM injections of pharmaceutical grade NAD+.  

The NAD+ is soluble in .09% Saline Solution at roughly 100mg/ml however generally speaking there are 10-20 undissolved milligrams of the compound left over after filtration. Day 1: 200mg dissolved in Saline Solution, roughly 100mg is drawn up using a 1ml leur lock syringe with a 5/8"" 27 gauge needle. First Attempt is done intravenously. Luckily after getting 20-30 units down I had lost the vein. Seconds later my mind and body were completely taken over by the drug. At first I thought I may die but quickly realized this was just my body adjusting to the (what at the time) was a large expanse of NAD+ into the body. After that passed the feeling can only be described as overwhelming, somewhat euphoric and somewhat uncomfortable. After this experience I decided to continue my NAD+ treatment using intramuscular injection, slowly titrating the dose until I reached the desired effects.  

I then dissolved the other 100mg of NAD left over and injected it into the muscle tissue. After waiting ten minutes there were no overwhelming feelings or side effects. This was on the last Friday of May 2020 After coming home from being out for the weekend I continued the titration to effect on May 31st. I opted to inject 200mg in two seperate doses in a 1ml leur lock syringe. This went well however after about an hour I noticed a mild headache that while typical did last until I took 1 500mg tylenol four or five hour after. Monday I continued by repeating the 200mg injections, waited 2 hours after noting no side effects aside from a very mild and brief intensity of heart rate which I had noticed previously. The only way I can describe the feeling is as if my heart feels like it weighs more and is sort of popping out of my chest, nothing like the feeling of accelerated heart rate due to cocaine or amphetamine use. It is an entirely alien feeling in that regard which can make you worrisome but this is soon went away while not only the side effects subsides but the NAD+ begins to have its function as an anti anxylic.  

The second injection went smoothly with no notable side effects other than a mild increase in body temperature. Tuesday I proceeded to take 2 300mg injections over the course of 5 minutes. This one done using a 1 1/4"" 27 Gauge Luer Lock Needle and a 3ml (300unit) syringe. I slowly pressed down on the 3ml plunger and was surprised at how little the injection hurt. Just as soon as that one was finished I injected the next 3ml syringe into my dominant upper arm muscle and did notice some discomfort in terms of the speed of injection but given the total number of IM injections done there was nearly no soreness or pain afterwards compared in IM injections of Ketamine. It's as if the muscle tissue happily accepts the NAD+ and is not irritated at all by it's presence.  

After I had gotten to the end of my second injection on Tuesday I noticed mild abdominal discomfort which felt like the onset of diarrhea which only lasted a few minutes. No headache was noted since Sunday and the typical heart feeling was there but it was not anymore intense than any of the other doses and quickly subsided. Increase in body temperature appeared to be slightly more intense than before.  

In total over the 3 day period 1000mg of Pharmaceutical Grade NAD+ was Injected Intramuscularly Effects: The most notable effect not only from IM NAD+ but also N-Riboside was it's perceived immediate effect on anxiety. I did not experience an increase in energy until 25 hours after my last dose that didn't appear to peak until 24 hours past that. I noticed that on Monday and Tuesday I would wake up between sleep cycles wide awake feeling like I could easily get up and start the day but after 7-10 minutes I would fall back asleep. This side effect subsided on Wednesday when I got a full nights sleep and finally started to feel the effects of increased energy and motivation. Mentally I feel much sharper and feel far less socially inept which I can likely conclude has to do with lack of anxiety however the positive attributes of these effects appear to go beyond anxiety and into increased cognitive function and reasoning that results in relinquished anxiety (compared to say benzodiazapines that just numb out anxious thought). No Bruising or pain can be noted from the plethora of IM injections.  

On Tuesday I took my second dose of Methadone (50mg) and did note that it appeared to be more euphoric and energetic than usual which leads me to believe that the NAD+ had restored my Opi receptors to some degree. On Wednesday that after taking 1600mg of gabapentin until later realizing that the decrease of 100mg was causing severe anxiety I decided to take an additional 1200mg in the afternoon to see how it would effect me compared to how the same dose would effect me prior to the NAD+ Infusions. Taking the additional dose had strong effects that made it feel as if the NAD+ had undoubtedly rejuvenated GABA Receptors to some degree. It felt as if my tolerance had decreased quite a bit and hypo-mania and euphoria was far more prevalent than any other time I had taken an additional 1200mg which I would usually do once every 7 days.  

Thursday I decided to take my second dose of Methadone a day early instead of waiting to take it on Friday. While at first I did not notice any real effects it appears that due to diet or some other unknown part of the set and setting that no real increase in energy, euphoria, sedation or anything associated with the effects of an opioid could be noticed at all. It appears the now (3.5hrs later) that the dose has either just begun to work or is hitting it's peak plasma level. Now, roughly 4.5 hours after I am noticing mild sedation and cannot tell whether or not this is the dose waning or taking on a more sedative like effect. It should be noted that my second doses of methadone tend to waver between energetic and sedating and are usually taken once every 3rd day.  

Noted repair of Opioid Receptors and or increase metabolism: What I see as my ""hard evidence"" that the NAD+ has helped to repair my opioid receptors is the fact that when I wake up to take my morning dose of 53mgs of Methadone along with 10mg of Valium, 1200mg of phenibut and 1700mg of gabapentin to then fall back asleep and wait for my morning alarm that instead of falling right back asleep and remaining asleep until my 8 O' Clock alarm or later due to the sedation brought on by the valium and lack of stimulation from the onset of the Methadone that I now wake up within 1 hour after taking my morning medication. I have not had my MMT work in this fashion for well over 12 months, possibly even 16-18 months (I have been on methadone fro roughly 2 years). I was also taking a whopping morning dose of 110mg at the period of time when I would be woken up by the onset of methadone if I were to fall back asleep after taking my dose. It should be noted that if I do wake up and take my medication that instead of the regular 2-3 hours of dread that I feel waiting for my medications to kick in (when I usually do absolutely nothing but wait) that I am now actively interested in researching various topics and able to start the day on a much more energetic and positive note.  

Now on roughly 45% (\~50/110) of what my original dose was it appears that the NAD+ in my bloodstream has either: increased my metabolism significantly to the point that what would usually take 2-4 hours to reach workable (or peak) plasma levels to increase energy happens in only 45 minutes to an hour OR the NAD+ allowed me to feel the effects of the drug in a much stronger manor due to repairs that have occurred on the receptors themselves. I'm aiming towards the latter due to how similar it feels to when I would go back to sleep after taking 110mg during my first few months on MMT. It should also be noted that for the past 8-14 months that I would need to wait at least 2 hours before I would noticed any increased energy or motivation from the Methadone in order to get what I needed to get done during the day. The fact that the onset is not only coming on within 1 hour but also coming on strong enough that I will wake from what would otherwise be deep sleep shows extreme promise for this coenzymes ability to restore damaged receptors and increase cognitive function in general.",2,0

I'm a fucking addict. there's no denying it. i have been using dxm every single day since the end of april. I tried to quit once but the withdrawals were so intense and i just craved a high so 3 days clean didn't last very long. 

I lost a shit ton of weight. A lot of people are concerned for my well being but i keep telling everyone that im fine. I want my old life back. I wanna be the same work hard/motivated person i used to be before i started getting high everyday. I haven't been working at all, in fact I've been spending a lot of my hard earned money on nonsense. Its been adding up. 

I can't stop. I can't reach out for help in my real life because no one fucking knows about my addiction. Not even my closest friends. I do such a great job at hiding it that it would blow peoples mind if i confessed. 

I don't wanna tell anyone, especially my parents, they dealt with this before. I used dxm in 2018 and had a rough binge where my parents were involved and very scared for me. I don't wanna tell them because i don't want them to know I've been lying to them this whole time. I also don't want them to be worried for me at all times. 

I can't quit for a number of reasons.. One because of this fucking corona virus pandemic. One symptom i get from withdrawals is high fever/illness. If my parents see me sick out of nowhere they will instantly freak out and get me tested for corona and all that. I would have to hide the withdrawals, which might be my only option at this point. 

I really don't know what to do. I want my life back, I wanna stop this druggie lifestyle that I've been living for so long. Im getting tired of sleeping the days away and only waking up when its time for me to get high again.

I’ll just lie till Wednesday when I have work because there’s a dispensary right by my work I can hit and then tell my mom I broke my sobriety. I just wanna be high again.

My new addiction therapist said “If you really wanted to get cannabis and use then you would’ve” and my addiction was like “you know what, she’s right. Next time I will follow through on my want”.  Like she has no idea those words just encouraged and challenged my addiction. When I was in eating disorder treatment and they would say stuff like “if you really wanted to work out excessively last night then you would have” and so my eating disorder would respond with “you’re right, what the fuck was I thinking? We’ll have to do 100 sit-ups tonight” I just want to be high again. I will soon I’m sure. I dropped my anthropology class because even on day 4 of being sober I can’t keep up with the course work.

I have been into mdma for over a year, in february of this year a guy at my old job told me he was dealing and had heard from a mutual friend that I use mdma. He told me he could get some for x pills cheap. I had only ever done capsules of molly, not pressed pills. I didn’t do my research. I had heard from old heads that x pills used to be normal, they were basically the same as molly just maybe cut just a little bit with something else. I ended up buying a few from him. I looked up the design under “ecstasy pills” and found nothing but I guess I just assumed they were a rare kind, once again I’d never done pressed pills. I immediately formed a habit on these pills but I assumed it was because I was overworked and tired and I was using them as an energy boost. It spiraled. I started using them every single day, buying in bulk, taking 3-4 at a time. It didn’t feel quite like molly, but I thought it was because they were cut. I eventually realized it was completely out of control, my life had been about the pills for months and I’d lost myself. So I quit in July. I felt really ill after I quit, agitated and sore all over. But it passed and I thought little of those symptoms. I still want the pills all the time but I know I can’t, especially now. I happened across a news article with the exact pills Id been taking and to my horror, they were meth. I looked up every shape Id been given by the dealer and all were meth except one which was found to be mdma cut with fentanyl. I am mortified. It explains a lot of the things that I did during that time period as well as the feeling that I “need” them anytime I think about them. Anyway, that was a horrible discovery.

My addict that I am writing about is my husband of 6 years. We have been together for almost 10, we have two beautiful children Girl(4) and Boy(2). He is 37 and I am 38.

From my knowledge he has been addicted to cocaine since our daughter has been born. He has spend more then 50/60K on this addiction of his (again this is what I know) because the money has come out of our joint account, not to mention the money that he hasn’t been paying in to the house for the past year on regular bases. It’s always 400/500 bucks which can’t even buy me diapers these days. Every two weeks he should be giving me $1200 to cover the mortgage and bills/groceries/necessities. Unfortunately that’s not the case. I have been getting excuses and run arounds why he can’t be paying...I have gotten myself in to a hole where I have to feed a family of 4 with one income which has been a struggle...until some savings are still there it’s okay, but it’s depleting very quickly.

I have given myself until Christmas if things don’t change, I’ll serve him with divorce papers which at that point he has to get a lawyer to fight for the house or custody of the children. Knowing the fact that he is broke I think he might just walk away from everything.

There has been arguments in the house in front of the kids that I wish never happened but with his anger issues it’s hard to talk or have a normal adult conversation about anything.

Why is it so hard for me to leave? Well I think that I have to start from the bottom with everything ...who at this point would want to be with a single mother of two kids? 

If anyone has been through similar situations that can shed some light please let me know.

oh not to mention I have asked him to get help and he keeps on saying yes yes yes but never actually goes to get the help needed.",1,0

I now have a stable job, trusting relationships, a car, a stable living situation, etc.

I'm certain that I would have died had I kept using, and I'm certain that I will die if I use again. I just don't think I have another run in me. 

But lately I've been thinking about using frequently. Not necessarily even wanting to get high, just wanting to hurt myself, I guess. Since I know I'll die if I do use, I realize that putting a bullet in my head would be much simpler, but I'm far too much of a coward to do something like that. 

My employment currently consists of working with 2 special needs adults in a residential situation. I've been doing this since February, and when covid hit, I spent several months here every day, 24/7 to help lessen various human contact. I have a couple days off each week now, but I still work most of the time. 

One of the guys is pretty independent, but the other guy (let's call him Joey) has alot more needs. His diagnosis is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, so he's never really had a father figure in his life, and at 20 years old, his developmental age is more like 3-5 yo.

Joey asked me the other day, in so many words, if I could act as a father figure to him since he never had one. I told him absolutely, because, difficult as he can be behaviorally sometimes, I love this kid from the bottom of my fucking heart, and it's been a miracle to watch him grow over the past months.

The issue is, I'm not sure if I'm stable enough to be that person for him, and the spiral of thoughts that stem from this conundrum only serve to make me less stable. 

This year has been rough. My best friend moved away, who was also my band mate, so my band dissolved in that process. Another close friend of mine died from sepsis. Pretty recently my long term relationship dissolved as well, and if I'm being honest, I probably could have saved it if I had more time off. And, well... Covid, that's affected everyone. 

Part of me just wants to leave this job and take some time off for myself, but I'm worried that if I do that the weight of knowing I left Joey alone and confused would cause me to use again as well. Not to mention that that would just be totally unfair to him.

I guess I'd like to know if anyone has any insight into how you've dealt with responsibility in your addictions, either how it has helped you or caused any struggles.

he’s started to go to therapy, and his parents are kind of aware he’s going through a lot and he’s in the process of maybe getting admitted to rehab.

My 49 year old brother has been doing drugs for 30 years now. It started out with pot and has now advanced to Cocaine.

We have had multiple interventions where he agrees that he has a problem and says he wants to get better but does not get more than a few days before he uses again. I don't even believe him anymore when he says he wants to stop using. Note: There is no free therapy available and no money to pay for any.

Due to Covid, there are no in-person narcotics anonymous meetings available to attend. There are virtual meetings but he says these are no good (he only attended one). Note: he has never attended an in-person meeting before either so I believe he is just using the virtual meetings as an excuse.

He is divorced and has a 9 year old son who he has seen very little of in the last year.  There is a lot of tension and animosity between his family and his exe's family. His ex wife constantly cancels visits with his son at the last minute.  His ex wife also filed a court case looking for supervised visits but lost it. The judge chastised the ex-wife for not letting my brother see his son.  Still she continues to screw my brother and my mom over with canceling visits the last minute. In all honesty, his ex's family are horrible people who have made a bad situation worse. Note: the visits are with both my mom and my brother so the ex wife cannot use the excuse that they are unsupervised.

My mother has given him so much money over the years that she can barely support herself right now. Note: I have been telling my mom for 5 years now that she is going  to be broke herself soon and will then come to me looking for financial help. I told her I don't have enough money to help her if this happens + why should I support her because she cannot make the hard tough love decisions. My brother has had everything given to him for so long with absolutely 0 consequences for his actions.

My brother is so far in debt that his lights have been shut off, his cell phone has been shut off, his car will soon be repossessed and he has an immense amount of debt. It is only a matter of time before he officially loses his house. He is now living with my mom but continues to use every chance he gets. He comes home at all hours of the night and then sleeps most of the next day (he is not working). 

Seeing how my brother has taken advantage of my mom has essentially ruined my own relationship with my mom. I keep trying to explain to her that he will never get better until he hits rock bottom and continuing to support him in any way (financial, giving him a place to sleep) is not helping him. 

To make matters worse, my mom is recovering from a heart attack. I personally believe the stress of my brother using contributed to the heart attack and I am legitimately afraid she is going to have another one.

This is going to sound very cruel but this has been going on so long now that I just want to be done with both my Brother and my mom. It has affected my sleep and my stress levels have been crazy high.

This is now affecting my own marriage. To make matters worse, I truly believe my mom does not like my spouse. My mom is the type of parent who believes her children are perfect and all issues in her 3 Children's marriages are the fault of the spouses.

I don't even know what advice I am looking for. I don't see how we can help him if he does not want to help himself. It seems like every time I speak with my mom, we argue. It has gotten to the point where I don't want to talk to my mom anymore as it just upsets me so much. But then I feel incredibly guilty for feeling this way.

I guess the advice I am looking for is how do I look after myself and my own marriage without feeling guilty if something happens to my mom or my brother? I am not sure I can live with myself if something happens to either of them but I also cannot keep going on this way. I need to somehow get off this merry-go-round

Thanks for any advice and sorry for the ramble.",1,1

Or is state of the ark treatment and investing into research a better option ?,"D.A.R.E was a failure every drug PSAs ever turned into a joke. I mean big pharma has a plan to make pills less easy to crush and dissolve in water, but that'd literally just result in people turning away from the relative safety of pharmacies and to the street which increases overdoses. I think drug PSAs and addiction prevention programs should be less vague (""this is your brain,..this is..."") and more real and honest. Explain why people get addicted (first time, impulse, mental health issues, suicidal, etc) and stay addicted( initially they like the high, the rush, the euphoria, etc but this fades over time and it's reduced to nothing eventually, so the only motivation to use is to prevent withdrawals and the the hope that the high will return.  Then explain why it isn't worth it for anyone regardless your motive. Be truthful, and even when it comes to the high and why some folks chose It but then follow up by explaining why that's not the healthy option or how addiction isn't even a slightly logical option. I think addiction prevention should be a mandatory class taken k-12. Like, yeah explain what needs to be explained but there's no need to show a giant wall of paraphernalia, a fake pot farm, or a meth lab simulator. Don't exaggerate the effects of the drugs because if it's found out to not be true they will disregard everything you say. When D.A.R.E came to my elementary school, I had watched enough drug inc to know everything, but right off the start the sheriff said you could overdose on pot which is a bold face lie, so I disregarded everything else he said. When it comes to pot, it's important to not exaggerate anything about it because more than likely a third of the class has smoked it before and anything you say negative about it you better be able to prove real quick. Don't go off big pharma funded studies or anything biased either because if you have an article, they will  have one too saying the opposite. Keep weed short and simple, 2-3 irrefutable facts and move on, it's better if they don't smoke pot but it's not necessarily gonna ruin their life. Heroin, meth, cocaine, they will ruin your brain, your life, everything you believe in that's not an exaggeration saying that about pot or psychedelics. There's already a stigma it just important to explain, in great detail why the stigma exists. So they leave the classroom everyday with a greater understanding of why not to use addictive drugs. It's important to recognize who's most at risk so everyone does a personality test, and those greatest at risk. Do you think a class, k-12 so it is ingrained into a young persons brain daily why it's bad for you on another level.",1,0

Whatever it was by now I've surely swallowed.

Now my body is heavy upon waking as I just crave relief

My wallet is light from chasing my high by any means

More moral compass changes as I run low on funds

Now I'm contemplating doing things I never would have done. 

I hear a voice in the back of my head saying ""Stop this isn't you!""

But I've already gone so far I respond ""What else do I have to lose?""

I'm just another addict who resorts to the bottle when I'm in pain

but how much longer before I'm dead or decide to change?

Through wasted times I've lost all my purpose

Now even the thought of life, well, it makes me nervous.

The bottle was a thief robbing me of peace

attempting and failing to use any substance as a release.

I've been filling a void for so long the old me is lost 

but each day becomes clearing and I'm no longer engulfed in a fog.

With help I don't need the bottle to satisfy although at times I still think I do.

I'm being taught that once I get it and the high passes I'll just be back to craving something new.

I lived for so long as an extension of the bottle but am finding a new identity

Knowing now beyond any doubt if I start using again my using will embody me

The success I am aspiring to is now within reach, but I'm still hungry for more

so I keep going to every meeting letting fellow addicts move me forward.

I tell myself that I've got to stay sober and I know I can ""one day at a time""

Those 5 mores are what I grasp onto when it feels as though I'll lose my mind.

All those past years I had spent wasted never essentially went to waste,

This is my community and I am asking about this because I  trust the experience of this community when It comes to this stuff
My brother has been taking it since middle school 5mg pm. and it's not clear to me if he was put on a taper first and because he has autism I look out for him in these matters, ones where he could end up acting crazy and his autism is blamed , when in reality he may have been told he could stop cold turkey without a taper.He is very responsible about meds, to his credit, he has been asking to stop them for 2 years. 
He has been on Clonidine 5 mg every single night for 13 years . I want to mention he also discontinued Prozac which he has been taking 10mg every other night for a year .
Now 2 days ago he was told he could discontinue everything. The thing is , he has been way off the past couple of weeks to begin with ( covid lockdown getting to him) and I have a suspicion that his helper has been trying to admit him so zhe can get unemployment ( not to go into crazy town here but he really has been difficult and I myself could imagine chewing my own arm off at times for a break ) 
      Anyway I believe him when he says he hates the medicine and so stopping is indeed good overall, it's  just that cold turkey gives me a scare 
      I want to be educated on what to possibly expect this week. 
       Thank you so much for any insight or experience .

Update : clonidine 0.1 taken every evening for 16 years , no taper. Instructions to discontinue. I suspect it may be problematic but hope not .

I need help.","Little background story: from an early age, I have identified myself as the insecure type, with self-esteem problems and all. I had trouble connecting with people because I always thought I had nothing to offer. Even though I have wonderful parents and a few close friends who I'd literally die for, I have always felt lonely and isolated. My first job helped me to deal with it a little better, but the general feeling that I am just a sad piece of shit always lingered on and on.

Well, fast forward to August 2019. I was finally getting the recognition I deserved in my job, had a few savings in the bank, went back to college, my grades were superb. I was happier than I had ever been. Then, I started going to parties and I finally had the chance to satisfy my lifelong curiosity about what the feeling of getting high on something was like. Then, I met cocaine. Only did it on weekends at first, and I loved it. And then I started to think it was the answer to my lifelong struggle with my own insecurities. Does not take a rocket scientist to figure out the rest of the story, does it?

Anyway, here I am, one year later. Can't function without it, can't function with it either. Got into a massive pile of debt, quit my job because I just could not cope with it anymore, and I'm starting to fear for my grades in college. Lost 22 pounds in the last couple of months or so, I'm looking like death on two legs, borrowed a considerable amount of money from my parents to keep my addiction going, and I have basically forgotten what it is like to enjoy a meal or have a decent night of sleep. To put the icing on the cake, my insecurities have basically been skyrocketed by my addiction.

Right now, I am honestly wondering why the fuck I am still alive and what I am waiting for to just put a bullet in my brain. My parents do not know about my condition and I do not want to crush their souls with it, and I constantly lie to the very few friends of mine who know about it and have been nothing but loving and supportive to me about it. I'm desperate and in need of advice, help, support, kind words, anything that will help me clean this mess. I need to start living again, because right now I feel like every one of my actions is directed towards the next high. I cannot keep living like this.

Thank you to those who read it. If you are currently struggling with an addiction like I am, I hope we can both make it out of this.",48,0

I understand it, I’m not okay with it or happy about it and it’s not without consequence, but the people around us/him....are so wildly offended and upset and feel personally attacked by him breaking sobriety.

Honestly this is just a rant, so pay no attention","This may sound stupid as fuck but I’m addicted to cannabis and Xanax. I’m 5 days clean but I really want to feel different from this depressive state I’m always in so I drank some vodka my mom has in the freezer and I’m watching Euphoria. Probably not the healthiest thing for me. I’m in an intensive outpatient program for addiction. I’ve been addicted to hunger, cutting, Ativan, Xanax, cannabis and stealing all my life. Literally since I was 5 I’ve been depressed and turning to vices everyday. I’ve been high for like a year straight since my grandma committed suicide. I just drank vodka but I’m not feeling enough to be satisfied. I just want to change my emptiness. I don’t think I’ll ever be cured. I’m pretty sure I’m about to enter a life of sadness and addiction. I’m tipsy but it’s not enough. The vodka is my mom’s, I’m 22 and still living with my mom. Pathetic, right? I drank straight from the bottle, I hope she doesn’t remember how much vodka was left. I tried to find her weed pen battery to juice out the rest of a few carts I have left over but I think she hid it from me. I know I’m supposed to be sober but fuck that noise. I just want to be happy. I want to drink the whole bottle but that would for sure be noticed. I love how accessible weed and alcohol is, I know for sure I can easily get some with just a little money. I wish xanny was as accessible but whatever. I can get a prescription I’m sure, if not I’ll go to someone though I don’t know anyone I could buy off. I want to be high out of my mind but I’ll settle for drunk. I know I’m not sober right now, when I lift my hand to my face it feels like numb. I wish I could try Mollie. I wish things were as simple as Euphoria drug access. I’m not sure I’m making sense. I don’t think there are any rules here right? I hope I’m not crossing any lines with this post, it’s my first. I hope I don’t throw up tonight from vodka but I also really want more. I wish I could be high right now. Okay that’s it, I’m out!",2,0

I’ve tried that before and i can go a week at best before using again. I am waiting to get into therapy/treatment but it isn’t for 2 weeks (after waiting another 2 weeks for an intake appointment). I want to start quitting now and try to be fully done in 1-2 months if possible. Any good suggestions on tapering down?

I've been sober for a month and a half now. 
It started when I turned 18. 
I was homeless living in motels in Florida. 
I wasn't homeless cause my parents kicked me out. 
I was homeless cause I got kicked out of my uncle's house for drinking to much and snorting prescriptions.
My dad always stuck by my side and my mother is an amazing person and none of my drug problems had anything to do with them.
I was in a hotel in a bad area and wanted some Coke, I had been drinking and therefore didnt care who I asked. One dude lmk his girls would be back but didnt know if they had coke.
They came back and I immediately started hitting on them.
One took a liking to me and she told me she didnt have coke but she had ice. 
I didnt know what Ice was so I said fine let's do it. 
She asked if I had done it before and I acted like I'd have done it a thousand times. Well before I know it were in her room and she does 2 lines. HUGE LINES BTW. I snorted it immediately and omg. I was feeling great. We walked around the bad part all night till 7 am and I found out the next day they were hookers. I bought more that day and did it the entire time Down there. I ran out of cash and my dad and I moved back up to TN. My homie here in TN did ice so it was easy. I did it for months straight. Not sleeping for days. Doing it when I woke up. Met a girl in TN addicted too so we got together and it turned bad. I hung out with my plug months later doing ice all night. Ketamine. Smoking weed. And drinking. It was days of memories that are a blur. 
1month later. I've changed my life.
My father died. 
We were in the same car wreck.
But my father didnt make it. 
I'm glad I'm sober.
I wish I hadn't wasted so much time on drugs and more time with my family. My dad and I were together the entire time. He never left me behind. I love you dad aka my best friend. RIP 
Addiction isnt worth the time you miss with family.
Thank you god for helping me through my addiction.",11,0

Which I'm very proud of, however, along the way I stumbled across Kratom.   In the past I have dabbled with percs too, but never too serious (because it was never available).  Had percs/pain killers been available, I'd probably be in a bigger whole than I am now.  Anyway, back to Kratom.  I've been using Kratom every day at least 15-20gpd for the past five years.  I quit for a couple months a couple years ago.  I got bored, stopped going to meetings and started up again.  I want to stop.  I want to feel better, I want peace, I want everything that's promised on the other side of dependency.  I have had a sponsor in the past, and went to meetings every day for about a year.  I was happy, but clearly I'm an addict and couldn't leave well enough alone.  I hate the way I feel when I wake up.  I hate being snappy, mad, depressed and everything else...which is my doing.  I have some subs that I will be using the first week or two to help me get off of kratom.  I understand the seriousness of using them to aid my recovery.  I have also had a stint with them for about six months.  But , I will only being using them for the first week or two like I said at low doses.  More importantly, I want to work on my mental well being, going to meetings and being happy again.  The only concern is that the relationship I am in , I've been in for over five years.  My s/o uses kratom too and is a recovering alcoholic.  S/O also was in the military and is very head strong.  What I mean by that, is I've tried to bring s/o to AA meetings, and they just weren't having it.  S/O thought it was cult like and was brainwashing me and everyone else there.  I love this person very much and want to get better with them.  I also understand two dead batteries won't start a car. I spoke to s/o about this this morning and they said they were game to stop and do meetings, but I really hope it isn't just words.  I'm really just venting and hoping maybe someone may have some advice, or has been down a similar path.  Thanks for letting me share.",3,0
