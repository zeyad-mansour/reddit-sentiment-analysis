There's something wrong with me, a lot of things actually and I've spent so many countless hours trying to dodge it. The simple fact is, I'm faulty.
The wiring within me has been stripped. I get shocked everytime I show emotion. Which again, I'm ashamed of. 
Drugs and alcohol give me the same warm feeling I get when I'm hugged.
I don't even remember the last time I've been hugged. I crave the euphoria.
I crave the butterflies beating against my ribs. 
Something else I crave? Adrenaline. I miss driving 100 down a back road high off morphine not giving a fuck if I died. I know there are safe ways to get an adrenaline rush however I've never been a safe person. I say yes to everything.

Growing up I watched all the adults in my life use heavy drugs, drink alcoholically  and function fairly normally. Held down jobs, paid bills and they lived a life that seemed good. I know how to survive and I can’t help but think that even in my years of sobriety I was so overwhelmed that I completely checked out of life. Nose to the grind handle business. Great jobs, educational advances, prestigious acknowledgments, community involvement and healthy kids that grew up well taken care for. So why not be in survival mode loaded? Well it’s definitely not the same and I feel like I’m dying inside. Every time I receive a compliment or achieve a shred of success I cringe and want to scream. Why don’t they see my soul is fading and I can’t stop. Looking good on the outside creates an illusion that everything is great. Beautiful people are happy people. Sexy people are fun. Wealthy people are responsible. Ha if only the false beliefs our culture has embraced were true. I know what I did before to get sober and I can’t seem to get there again. Broken heart and crushed dreams have me in a darkness that seems to have swallowed me hole. I use daily and maintain a fairly normal lifestyle. Pretty sure kids are suspect but no one says anything. Why doesn’t anyone say something?!?! It’s lonely here and it’s not fun but there is a level of pride and accomplishment each day that my secret remains hidden. Addiction seems to be a passive attempt of suicide. Longing for the day it takes me away or I loose my mind. When life is so lovely and full how can I be empty and  hopeless. Maybe sharing here will lift the burden and build my self worth enough to change?",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6821949}"

My addict boyfriend and I got together after he'd been sober a few years.

The pandemic hit and our county has been in lockdown since. All his support and ways of coping, including his job, just shut down.

Since then he's in a cycle of relapsing, trying to get sober without structure and support, relapsing again
.. On and on.

He just started another relapse two days ago and I just can't do it. I love him, but I hate seeing him wasted, I hate worrying about him and I loathe the people he associates with when he's drug seeking.

So I'm planning to send him this message, and would really like to hear your thoughts on it, or suggestions of what might need changing etc.

Obviously you've hit another cycle of drug seeking.

I love you, but I can't go through this with you again right now for my own well-being.

Please be safe, please be careful, please look after yourself.

Hit me up when you're ready to be sober, and I'll show up with my full love and support.

Love you [pet name]""

So, does this sound OK? Would you change anything? If so, what would you change?

Not feeling hungry, not eating. And the thing is I can’t tell anyone but my friends. I live with my family but if they knew I’ve been smoking for 3 months nonstop in their house I don’t know what’d happen. I want to tell them so bad so I can get some sympathy. I’m going to a family doctor tomorrow, hopefully I can spill the beans to them and get the help I need. I’m tired of this. Of laying in bed all day, of worrying endlessly, nothing that used to be fun is fun, the loneliness, the despair. I made such a huge mistake.

It’s mostly binge eating fast food and watching a lot of porn that slowly became my new vices, even though I was in a relationship with a women I thought was fine af. For context my pops is a recovered heroin addict so I know that I carry the “addictive gene” I guess you could call it. But basically ever since I stopped smoking weed habitually those have been my main vices. I know its not healthy at all and for 6 months I’ve been trying to crib these habits. The furthest I get is having a good week of not eating fast food and watching porn only a few times that week but the following week, I go on a binge. I’m muscular but with a belly so I just want to cut and I know watching too much porn fucks with your head so I want to stop going off with these things. But what I need to know is how should I go about stopping this for real? Also how can I relieve stress in a good and what can I make a positive vice?

I fell in love with someone who did not love me back. I gave her my soul. For her, I lied I hid and I spent money I did not have. 

Being with her was like entering my childhood again. The sun was shining and it was amazing. I was smiling at trees (for the first time, I noticed there are so many different kinds around my neighborhood). All of the cars passing by excited me. The different makes and colors-I could just sit there and watch the world with her for hours.

She made me feel like music was entering my body. Not figuratively, but literally like magic. The music would enter my hands first then spread throughout my whole body. I was back to my early memories of discovering my favorite songs. It was like hearing them for the first time over and over. It was beautiful and surreal. Some nights we stayed up till 5 AM listening to love songs for hours. We laid there covered up in blankets, perfectly intertwined. I remember thinking if I passed away tomorrow, I would go happily.

It did not matter if I had a bad day at work, I knew she would comfort me when I got home. With her, it did not matter if I havent left the house in days. If I missed my lunch date with my friends. If I had five dollars to last me for the week. She was the only thing that mattered because she completed me. I would have given her my life. I would have lost it all just to keep her.

Saying goodbye is hard. I miss her on my worst days and I think about her in the middle of the afternoon. But I remind myself everyday it was simply not meant to be. Even though I loved her dearly, she will never feel the same way about me.",51,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.83670306}"

Starting from her uncle to close friends. 

What we found out during the RTT session that she started from social smoker to fit in. When we found out that this is the root cause and we don't need it anymore the addiction was released.

Like most, it started when I was a student. I just graduated graduate school this past August and was using it regularly throughout my 7 years of college, with an average of about \~20 mg-30 mg/day. I was very productive, learned a lot, and excelled in my program. When I DIDNT need to study, I DIDNT take adderall. I looked forward to breaks. 

Now, I've been graduated for almost 8 months and I have a full time job, but this time I'm  taking adderall \*\*daily\*\*. It \*does\* help me a ton at work (healthcare provider), and in that sense it is very helpful. 

\*\*BUT\*\* my brain tries to convince me that I need it to get absolutely anything done. Stupid things-- cleaning my house, exercising, doing laundry. And then when I take it, I  feel super guilty about it the entire day and end up with anxiety regarding my adderall use. I get very hard on myself about it. 

I take about 15-25mg per day, depending on whats going on... When I have a 13 hour shift, I average around the 25 mg/day, but more like 15-20 on the average day. 

I am prescribed 10mg IR x3/day (total of 30 mg/day). I have never run out-- in fact, I have a butt ton of extras. \*\*BUT,\*\* I actively want to stop/decrease my usage, and it seems impossible...

Need advice!,"I used to be addicted to weed to escape my trauma, which never works in hindsight. I was completely non-functional and burning through an excessive amount on the daily. I had multiple conversations with my bf and we decided to no longer keep it in the house. We also agreed that if we ever wanted to smoke again, we'd make sure it's not daily.

...Until this year. Without warning me, my bf started smoking again as he started school again with a friend of his. I thought I was losing my mind, thinking that I could smell it in the house and it caused huge anxiety for me.

Ever since he's been smoking daily (2-4 joints per day, maybe more if he's being dishonest again) he has been forgetting to do chores, is almost never mentally present and it seems I'm no longer a priority in his life. It took a while but he is now keeping the weed in his car so I don't have to smell it as it's a huge trigger.

Another reason this upsets me is he used to habitually smoke and drive. He now keeps his keys at home when he goes to school because when his friend offers him a joint at lunch he never stops to think ""oh, I'm driving, I shouldn't"" - I think he just can't say no when it's offered to him. 

His perspective: he says he now has the healthiest relationship with weed he's ever had - but I don't think this says much if it has been an unhealthy relationship since the beginning. 

I can't envision a day in the future where we're both sober in the house. I think he has a problem, he doesn't. Do I need to chill? Is he in denial? I'm so confused, please give me insight on this situation.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.747103}"

**Now (18M) For the last 3-4 months I've been:**

Taking daily 60mg Adderall **or** 30mg + lots of coffee. Also like alcohol bc I get drunk quickly but only drink on Fridays and Saturdays.

Numb personally, I'm usually a positive and humorous person, now I'm a zombie.

Depend on Adderall for weight loss and good grades. I've never forgot to take Adderall in the morning, not sure if I'd go thru withdrawal if I missed a day.

Consume around 300-500 calories daily so the Adderall can affect me more (reduce appetite). Lost 50lbs in 2 months but I'm at the average weight for my height (155lbs, 6ft). Pretty happy with my weight but still intend on losing more.

Within the last 3 months I've had (continuously):

* Sleeping difficulties
* Shaky hands and sometimes body
* Dry mouth
* Loss of appetite and sense of thirst
* Weight loss
* Pounding heart or fast heart rate
* Dizziness went standing up and I sometimes nearly faint
* Shortness of breath
* Blistering skin

I understand I'm abusing the amphetamines and it's affecting my brain, kidneys, and other parts of my body. I'm afraid to stop bc I'll start to gain weight and won't be able to focus on my studies. Also don't want to reach out for help within my family because my parents (a cop and a therapist) are strict and they'd tell my family doctor to cut my prescription because I'm abusing it.

My friend/ex-gf is addicted to meth. She has a history of mental health issues which means that the heavy meth use inevitably sends her into psychosis. During the psychosis, she's completely withdrawn, - doesn't talk to family or friends, doesn't register things when we text them to her (like she wont respond or will not comment on any texts we send her even if they are about general stuff). Her bf is her dealer and so she has shelter, food and drugs taken care of. I should emphasize, her psychosis is bad, really bad.

She says that there are no issues with her use, that it's not even an addiction. To give you an idea of how bad things are - in the past 2 years, she has been 5150'd for 12 days, gone back home twice to try and get away, broken her front tooth, had her dog taken away by her dad (which she got back later), lost her job, had an abortion (not clear who the dad was).

I've tried approaching the topic as ""hey what do you want out of life?"" - Her response is that she wants a fun and exciting life where she travels, gets to dress up, goes to events etc. (I should mention here that she is very very attractive and if she was not addicted to meth she would probably be a trophy wife for a rich guy).  At other times she says she wants to be independent and have a job.

Now here's the issue - In her current state she basically spends her time 3 ways - 1) Sitting at home hearing voices and doing god knows what 2) Riding around with her bf/dealer as he does his part time delivery job 3) Goes out to other people's houses/parties who also use drugs.

I don't know how to point it out to her that what she wants from life is on the opposite end of the spectrum to what her current life is. Of course, she immediately goes into denial if I bring up these topics with her (She just needs to get settled and will get a job then, she's not in touch with people cause she doesn't need to be etc.). Any ideas how to talk to her? I'm not looking for a magic word to get her to change but how do I subtly put these ideas into her head?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6538318}"

I just found out yesterday that my boyfriend has been addicted to percocets for the past couple months. We live together and have the same bank account etc, so I'm feeling so shitty for not seeing this happening before now, but that is just a whole other thing. 

He has a history of addiction and has been to rehab before, but before met him. He thought he could take this stuff recreationally and it would be different this time, but obviously it didn't work out like he thought. I love him so much, and I'm not leaving him because of this. He was afraid to tell me because he thought I would kick him out. I have my own mental health issues, and I know he didn't choose this, so leaving him isn't anything I would even consider.

Anyways, what I'm here to ask is for advice. My boyfriend was confronted by his manager yesterday about what was going on, and his manager was very understanding and gave him next week off to detox. We are currently weaning him down. I have no experience with this exact type of situation personally, so I just have no idea what I am in for.  I want to help him as much as I can, I'm actually going to take the week off so that I can be there for him. We talked about it, and it was a decision we made together to do it this way. 

Please feel free to give me any advice that you have, or if you can give me some idea for what I'm in for. Sorry for the long post.

If choosing the later, then I would be stopping by the closest 24-hour pharmacy right before the day ends - I want no drugs. No sleep pills. No alcohol. But get me all the available chocolate on the counter. Yes, I ruin my friends snacks, desserts, and the way they see their favorite meals when I tell them about the calories and carbs, still I am light years away to become a 'Mary Teresa' of low sugar & carbs diets. I mean, can I just eat a chocolate bar a day while you drink your bottle of wine? what if we share? Can we indulge in our addictions of choice without judgments. Shall I give up my chocolate doses so you have a better view while dinning outdoors and stare at people's bodies? or do I just enjoy myself? This is my drug, and yes...

2021-03-28 18:02:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mfb371/addicted_to_weed/,Addicted to Weed?,"Hi guys,

Please go easy as I don't know where else to turn with this. I am 25 and I have had bipolar since I was 18. Since about a year ago I started smoking everyday, I smoke spliff's which are rolled with tobacco so I am no doubt addicted to that too. The weed was initially used to self medicate, and even though I am stable on bipolar medication - it stabilised my moods, and I have always enjoyed it. 

I don't think quitting either of these things would be like anyone here is going through but the problem is I am suicidal without it. I am making inroads towards more medication, more therapy - anything to help me sort my bipolar out. It's so difficult because when I am smoking - even just a couple joint a day - I feel better, grounded, motivated, I do university work, I see friends, I work out, I meditate. But on days where I'm not smoking I feel miserable about where I am in my life, suicidally depressed...... and when you're faced with that or smoking weed? which you like to do? well.... it's so hard to choose to be suicidal. I'm terrified of killing myself, my family are the only and best thing in my life and they know and understand my usage. 

Obviously, I know of the risks of weed and bipolar - I have only found it to be helpful to me. I also suffer from PTSD, I was in an abusive relationship from ages 18-22 and that weighs heavy on me as well. Sometimes I think fuck it, I will just continue to smoke weed and continue to seek help for my bipolar until I am in a place where I am not suicidal when quitting. And that feels okay, smart even. But I feel such shame when I smoke, often when I sit back and think 'you know what I feel great' I immediately feel bad because it's the weed that's made me feel this way. 

It's so hard without it. It's monumental. I just need some advice. Am I addicted to it and am ruining my life? Am I playing with fire? How do I even begin to pick apart what my next steps are. I am so sorry if this is so minimal compared to what people are going through here but I just want to be happy so so badly, but my mental health makes it so hard.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5442851}"

>  
>  
>  
>First off, hello, and thank you for taking the time to read this, might be a bit of a read but i feel like i have to explain a lot to be able to put things into perspective, just how i am i guess.  
>  
> I'm currently 20, and a recovering meth addict. Ive been using since I was 18; last year I was able to stop for about 8 months (unfortunately by getting arrested.....) then got a new job and met the wrong crowd again, and ive occasionally been using over the course of the past 4 months, trying to work to get off it again. Theres a little backstory on my current situation. 

Now the part where i would like some input. 2020 was a rough year for us all, for me personally it has made me feel depressed and extremely loney; I was  jobless for about half the year, and didn't really talk to anyone besides occasional smalltalk. Im an introvert so it wasnt terrible at first. But after a whole year of not talking to anyone but my best friend whenever we hung out, (i live at her parents) its gotten to me.  

1st part of the problem: Besides my bff i have 1 other friend that im still sorta close to, and some of my (ex) coworkers. Tbh being an introvert that plenty, but out of all those people I dont feel like I have anyone I can talk to when I need someone to be there. Not anyone mature enough to give me real sound advice, theyre all stoners. This wouldnt be a problem if I knew how to make real friends, like outside of work, etc. I was raised in a pretty strict Christian household so until I got my first job at 16, I literally just stayed in my room reading, or outside in our yard. I didnt really have any friends growing up because my parents kept us TOO sheltered. Oh and might I add I was homeschooled K-12. So ya i never really was able to develop many social skills. 

2nd part of the problem: because of my occasional usage, the small amount of energy i had built up while i was clean is almost just gone. Over the past month ive been trying as hard as i can to not touch it, i even quit my job to avoid being around the people that can get it. Im able to funtion normally with the exception that I dont have energy to do much... at all. Because of this that just makes me sit at home/ in my room usually alone, playing LOL and random games on steam to pass time. 

Now for the conclusioin of my problem. Having quit my other job about 3 weeks ago I dont have much income besides my 2nd job on the weekends. I have been still doing a job search and  decided I would like to try to get a certain position at Walmart. I live in a small town so theres that and factiories for halfway decent pay. But I havent filled out the applifcation and at the rate im going it wont happen for a hot sec. I can get by, as my rent is very cheap and the recent stimulus i saved for this reason. But I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME, convince myself to put the effort in to get another job, for a few reasons; I have been really depressed, especially the past month or two, and because of all the inner turmoil ive just kept bottled up to myself over the past year, and the hell I went through in 2020 (not going into detail but the big things were losing someone who  was one of the only legitimate  friends ive ever had and like a big brother to me because i got arrested, and the fact i was severely depressed and self harming a lot and even tried to end it,) Because of everything I feel numb, like an empty shell. I have little motivation to take care of my basic needs and have slowly been losing my will to live again, I am not lying when I say I do not remember the last time I legitimately felt happiness from something, or really enjoyed something, I have to force myself to watch anime and play games to pass the time because I feel, have felt, that dull and empty for a hot min.

Ok sorry ill wrap it up here, so Ive been putting off applying to walmart because I definitely am not in a good state of mind right now, plus i have very little energy, and spending 3/4 of every week working while having to sleep the rest of the time sounds detestable, fuck that. I compare it to basically being in prison for a set period each day but you get paid money to work there, because life is rigged, which is another thing that drags me down. I also am 99% sure I have had Borderline Personality Disorder, for a year at least, maybe two. Even with my colorful history of mental problems I havent ever had the money to get diagnosed. 

I do not want to apply for a job knowing i cannot mentally handle anything like that, but eventually im still going to need to pay rent, insurance, etc. But until i keep slowly building my energ

So I would like any advice or info as to what i should so for a job, ive considered work from home, i dont have any skills (that i know of) and so would have to learn one but no clue where to start.

Would also like any input you may have on how to cheer myself up sometimes, to be happy even over trivial things. AND HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS OUTSIDE OF WORK AKA REAL LIFE.

I’ve been crying and so out of focus for the last two days it’s effected my work, to the point of messing up checkouts and cash. I’m 21 and my parents struggled with drug abuse. My mom got clean and I lived with my grandparents after juggling between my aunt and other family. My dad was abusive and never stayed sober, I was the youngest out of 4 daughters and now have a 5 year old brother he’s already lost. Two nights ago, he messaged me on Facebook through his 8th new account and attempt to message me so I messaged him back just to say hi for once, as I’ve tried to talk to him but get uncomfortable quickly because I don’t know him. I found out he moved to the same city I’m in and wants to meet up. All my family, even the ones related have said to either get a restraining order now or just tell him to go away/ if I meet him bring someone. I want to give my dad a chance because I’ve NEVER met him since being able to hold a conversation. But I’m honestly so scared. I always felt if I forgave my dad and met him, all the anger I’ve felt in my life would go away. I told him finally tonight I’m not comfortable meeting and I need time. But I’m hurting so bad. If I met him, I can’t bring my brother (different father) because of the abuse he suffered and his mental health because of my dad. I can’t bring my boyfriend (21) because he has back issues and can’t sit for a lunch, and I’d have no car to drive away in if it got to a situation where I felt I needed to leave. I’ve always been so angry at my mom and finally learnt to forgive her and became less of a horrible person. But again I’m too scared of my dad and the things my family has told me that I can’t bring my self to meet him. I’m hurting so much over this I don’t want to go to work anymore or do my classes. I need some kind of advice from anyone who understands this. Please if anyone reading this understands please reach out.

Everything was going great. I was treating her like a queen. We were inseperable. 

She was supposed to come over last Monday. And stay for three days. Last Sunday, she asked me late at night if I would stay with her if she relapsed. And tried to bargain with me saying she was much nicer when she uses and much more relaxed. I didn't believe that it would be good for her and she agreed, and I went to sleep not thinking much of it. 

I was expecting her to get to her grandma's the next day, which was Monday .And then I was gonna come pick her up. 

And then I didn't hear from her till Wednesday. 
And she messaged me and told me instead of going to her grandma's. She got a hotel room and did heroin a bunch of times and almost died. And that she came to her best friends house to live. And her friend got rid of what she had left and isn't gonna let her leave the house for a while so she can go through withdraws and try to get clean again.

She said she wasn't really feeling like herself and that we should wait a while before we talk. 
She said she knows she isn't herself and doesn't want to upset me.
And thinks a few weeks without talking is probably what's best for us. 
She said it's really bad this time. And that it's harder than it ever was before. And she thinks it isn't fair for me to wait for her so, I should see other people until she gets her shit together. 

I really care about her and wanna be there for her now more than ever. But she isn't letting me. She doesn't talk to me. She distances herself and doesn't reply for days.

We've dated on and off for 4 years, together for around 2/3s of that time. We started dating in June'20 as I was a few months into psychotherapy and was able to commit to a relationship again.

We both have abused cannabis and alcohol for 2 1/2 years, although I've fought my addiction and cut down to 0.05g/day from 0.8/day and just took the plunge to quit a week ago. She has not done the same, and has been using cannabis and the internet/video games to escape from her trauma and mental health. 

She impulsively broke up with me via a facebook voice message last week, and has since fallen into a deep mental health crisis (suicidal but no attempts up to right now). She refuses to talk to me because she says it will make her feel worse: I believe this is because I have been the only one to confront her about her drug abuse/escapism, and tried to get her to open up about her emotions and trauma.

I've sent her the number for the local addiction team and have spoken to her older sister earlier today about how drugs are affecting her (my ex, not the sister). Unfortunately, the sister is also an addict, and believes that cannabis is helping my ex to cope, rather than being a way of escaping reality.

I'm looking for advice as to what to do. She's moved back in with her mum and sister (both of whom have been emotionally abusive / is not a good atmosphere + she sleeps on the sofa because she doesn't have a bedroom there) because she has pushed everyone else away. I was the last to be pushed out. 

She has ramped up her drug use significantly over the past 2 weeks (going from 1 day smoke and 2 evening smokes to smoking every hour) and spends her time stoned, crying and talking about suicide. She won't talk to anyone about how she's feeling past saying 'I want to die' or 'I want to kill myself' etc, and is becoming more and more isolated. I believe she is talking to her psychotherapist, but she was on council ling for 9 months and barely engaged with it - scared she'll do the same with the therapy. She'd do the session and cry over her rolling gear, smoke, falling back into escapism until her next session.

Is there anything I can do besides asking her sister to persuade her to seek professional addiction help and encourage her friends to be more proactive in getting her to open up? She's pushed them all away before me, but I'm hoping they can try and rebuild the bridges

I'm scared she's going to try to take her own life soon

If you were in my ex's position, what would be the best thing for me to do to help her? I've said I need her to talk to me within 2 weeks or I can't see her again because I feel I need that boundary to preserve my own mental health/substance abuse remission, but I also feel immensely guilty for putting pressure on her.

## this article explores the concept of ""getting high,"" how it works and why we do it, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of our circumstances and situations. without using the lessons that we learn to help move us forward, knowledge is only POTENTIAL power. 

## 

## ‘getting high’ – what is it?

**Cough syrup, toads, nitrates, bath salts, alcoholic tampons, loperamide, OTC sleep-aids, nutmeg, air freshener – you name it, we’ll find a way to get high on it.** Go ahead, think of something that *cannot* be abused. I’ve got $10k in a trust for the first person to come up with a plausible example (not really, but I should)!

“Getting high.” You hear talk of it almost everywhere you turn – friends and family, television and movies, news, social media. It’s as common as the cold, if not even moreso. In the right context, nearly everything in our world has the potential for abuse – that is, using something for purposes other than that for which it was originally designed or intended. Spoons, pennies, ice cream, meditation – all prospective problems if given the exact right opportunity.

As humans, we have a lot going for us. We are the most intelligent species on the planet. We have built – *from scratch* – buildings that make love to the sky. We’ve designed – *from scratch* – air travel nearly by the speed of light. With our own sweaty hands and bout of creativity we’ve connected every single person on Earth to each other via the Internet. We’re amazing, period. But, this can be as big of a downfall as it is impressive. With our intelligence comes boredom, with our creativity comes empathy, with our vast capability for emotion comes suffering.

As long as people have been people, we have searched for a way around this, for our paradise. A world without suffering, without hurt, without fear. A world where our amazing human qualities bear only positive features, none of the bad. Of course, for as long as we have searched we have found nothing because the world – the universe itself – is a game of balance. With the good comes bad and peace is found when the two are somehow equal, not when one is greater than the other or when one has been expunged.

There’s a Buddhist saying, it goes something like this: “Without pain there can be no empathy. Without empathy there can be no understanding. Without understanding there can be no compassion. Without compassion there can be no love.” So, for love to exist there must also be pain – but! The same is true the other way, for pain to exist, there must also be love.

Our way to paradise is not through the elimination of pain and suffering, but by the embracing of it. Just as everything has potential for abuse, everything also has potential for healing and light and goodness. You fall down not simply to fall down and sit there, but so that you can get back up, dust yourself off, and head out just to fall down all over again – but also to get back up again.

When we “get high,” we are more often than not trying to find peace. Our lives have become painful and instead of putting our energy toward fighting through to the other side, we spend our energy trying to escape it, because we ignorantly believe that we can. We are trying to find for ourselves our paradise, where it’s sunshine and bunnies and candy every day. What we’re really doing is making everything worse, making the battle that much more bloody, the war that much more brutal, and the victory that much further away.

What exactly is ‘getting high’ and what does it mean to ‘be high on something’? Well, the term itself is derived from the \[artificial\] elevation of one’s mood or mental state through the use of drugs and other chemical substances. Getting high is an action, a conscious and determined decision – and, keep in mind that the first time we get high and every time we relapse, it is a choice that we make while **sober**.

You smoke to get high, take a pill to get high, do a line to get high. After a while, it becomes routine, and eventually it becomes the sole purpose of all your days and nights. The cycle remains the same from first dose to last and goes something like this:

1. you’re sober
2. you dose
3. you wait for it to kick in
4. you’re high
5. the high starts to wear off
6. then the comedown; depression and panic, anxiety, fear, etc.
7. once again, you’re sober, except now you feel worse than before you dosed which may make you crave and seek out a follow-up, or chaser, dose.

Depending on the user’s physical and mental health, physiology, history, and current state, drugs can create different kinds of feelings and alter different aspects of our minds and bodies. Sometimes we get the intended effect and we feel like we can take on the world, but more often than not we also get the negative side-effects of having taken our DOC, such as panic, hysteria, depression, hallucinations, agitation and anger, stomach cramps, sweating and fatigue, rashes, malnutrition, sleep deprivation, and intense paranoia – to name a few.

Our moods can fall so low that we’re desperate for any kind of fix. We can feel so defeated, so exhausted, so futile that we beg and plead just to feel *okay* – we aren’t even asking to get high, anymore, we just want to feel normal. As early as our second dose, we find that we’re able to overlook all of the negative side-effects of getting high so long as our moods are lifted, even if just a smidgeon, even if for only a few moments. This, my friends, is addiction – the power behind our want to feel better is much stronger than any threat of the downside. As we discuss the process of getting high in more detail, we’ll start to understand why.

Drugs change how our bodies and minds function and behave. They alter cells all throughout our bodies which results in specific feelings, such as euphoria or an airy lightness. Mostly, drugs affect our central nervous system, either amping it up or depressing and relaxing it. Some drugs mimic specific cells in our brains that are already naturally present, some encourage hormone production, some cause specific reactions that result in pleasurable sensitivity.

## types of drugs – legal and illegal

Following is a list of illegal and legal drugs and narcotics. For more legal tips, check out[ jail & legal advice](https://rcs001.wordpress.com/jail/)

Some examples of illegal drugs are methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, and molly. Mostly, these are drugs that are concocted and manufactured illegally in someone’s bathtub or closet or storage unit. Sometimes they are a derivative of legal drugs, like how methamphetamine used to contain ephedrine. Sometimes, they re created from naturally-occuring substances, like how heroin is made from the poppy seed pod. And, sometimes, these are mixtures of other substances like how ecstasy can contain MDMA, methamphetamine, cocaine, and ketamine all at once.

Legal substances that are illegally abused are things like alcohol, inhalants, and OTC medications such as loperamide, benadryl, cough syrups, and motion-sickness treatments, and prescription medications such as benzodiazepines, muscle relaxers, and steroids. Opioids fall under this category, as nearly every single pill on the street comes from someone’s legal prescription. Alcohol can be illegally abused when the legal limit is reached or exceeded either in public or especially while driving. Inhalants are obviously legally sold but under very different context, as they are not meant to be ingested in any way, shape, or form.

Naturally-occurring drugs that are illegally abused are those such as marijuana and mushrooms, which have both have been a part of the human syntax as far back as history can see, being used for different medicinal purposes but, because of their potential for abuse, have been classed with the lower, more sinful echelon of pleasure as has most other abusable drugs.

Different drugs have different highs and different side-effects, they have different symptoms and target different areas of our bodies, they have different traits and characteristics, some are short-acting and some are long-lasting. Most drugs have medicinal purposes for which they were originally harnessed or designed. The concept of using medication to treat one’s ailment is as old as ailment itself. Since the first wound was dressed with yarrow, since the first fever was treated with willow bark, since the first burn was wrapped in aloe. Evidence of prehistoric medicine – like herbs, homeopathic and holistic tools and instruments, archaic wound-care – has been found in Europe, India, Egypt, Ancient Mesopotamia; Stone-age healing practices that date back to nearly 4,000 BC. In all this time, drugs – herbs, supplements, pills or leaves, tinctures and potions – have helped *countless* people lead *happier, longer, and more natural* lives than if they’d not had access to medicine or medical care. My mother, for instance, has a lot of pain with her multiple sclerosis, sometimes debilitating. While there is no cure, a strict regimen of pain medication helps her to do everyday things like laundry, dusting, grocery shopping, etc. 

However, we sometimes find that certain drugs – *like opioid pain medication* – cause within us certain feelings; they not only *take our pain away* but they *elevate our mood*. And when we stop taking drugs for their medicinal purpose or as prescribed and we start taking them *specifically to produce these good feelings* or to *alter our moods in any way,* its called “*getting high*.” 

We somehow ingest the drug, and the drug passes from our means of ingestion and into our bloodstream. From there it is carried to our brains where specific receptors are activated and chemicals are released and other cellular reactions occur. The brain is where most of the “high” feeling originates. Sometimes, depending on the means of ingestion and the drug itself, the high can take more than an hour to start taking effect and some can last as long as 48 hours to completely wear off.

## understanding how it works – and why it’s important to know!

What you’re going through – it’s certainly nothing new. People have abused substances since abusable substances have been around, since people have been people, since the start. But that doesn’t make it any less serious, any less strange and foreign, whether you’ve been around this block before or this is your first time. Learning more about your situation and your circumstances can help lead you in the right direction, or, at least it can give you some sense of direction either way. Like *Legos*, like building blocks, its important to lay a foundation of fundamental knowledge and elemental understanding, atop which to build a tower as high as your ceiling might rise. 

Understanding your addiction – what it does to your body and your brain, how it works and where it originates, its actual mechanism and function – can be a *tool, a weapon.* A little *understanding* and *familiarity* can help guide and direct you, can help light your way ahead, can help protect and defend you. It can remind you that there are *reasons* for these feelings and things are *not always as bad as they may seem*, that no matter what you’re feeling or thinking something *will* change. And almost always for the better – even if at first it seems for worse.

As there is no knowledge that is not potential power, the more you understand, the more power you’ve got on your side. Understanding *yourself*, forming a relationship with your own body and your own brain can be a start, certainly a step forward, *and forward is the right direction.*",0,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.525711}"

So Im new to this page as Ive recently discovered that my mother is using drugs again. Some background info: She lost custody of my sister and I about 6 years ago for a crack/cocaine addiction,she went to therapy and seemed okay for a while. Shes been through a lot of traumatic things from abusive relationships,loss and mental issues such as anxiety,PTSD,and depression. She was living out of state from me until about a year and a half ago and moved here to be close to my sister and I again. She was doing good,got established,regained her drivers license. 

Flash forward to last summer: She was drinking a lot,and was surrounding herself with people who just weren’t good people. My Mom has a habit of wanting to fix or help others but not herself. One of these people had a lot of problems mentally and told me that he witnessed my Mom snorting white powder off of her dresser (not sure if it was her pain pills or cocaine). I brushed it off because the guy was pretty out there and my Mom said he had lied because she wasn’t friends with him anymore(mind you she worked with this guy at a restaurant). She was fired a few weeks later and claimed her boss said customers had complained about her and he didn’t need her there(dick move right?-because I know my Mom was an awesome server). About a month later at my Moms birthday dinner out at a restaurant she showed up belligerent,drunk drove,along with a female friend of hers. They both were obviously high off of weed and drunk,but my Mom was a mess,and the way she was acting wasn’t just from smoking pot/drinking. My sister and I noticed she had white powder in her nose (when addressed my Mom denied and said it was baby powder that got on her face/nose-I was mad because I knew she lied but gave her the benefit of the doubt and knew hanging onto anger wasnt healthy and my hands were tied). 

Flash forward to the past couple months:
My Mom was doing okay,and even started coming to church with me and seemed to be getting into it. About a month or so later she became friends with a woman who had become homeless (had a whole backstory my Mom let her stay with her-she had mental issues and now I realize she was an addict). My Mom said she thought this lady was cursed and that some very strange things occurred (this lady would pull her hair out and say it felt like someone was braiding her hair,her voice would change-that she felt weird). Now my Mom being the person she is wanted to help her and was pretty worked up over this and convinced herself that this lady had a demon inside of her. She made the lady leave and had her house blessed (the 5 people who blessed her house said they didnt feel any presence). Things were fine for a couple weeks,my Mom came to church with me again and said she had found the Lord,meant a lot to me to hear that. I got married and she threw me my bridal shower and things seemed ok. Now after a couple weeks,she started saying there was something in her house,lost her new job from acting “aggresively at work” and claimed the demon that was in her friend mustve jumped into her. I asked her if maybe it could just be her anxiety,and her being alone in her apartment affecting her since she doesnt like being alone;she got angry and said I didnt understand and was convinced there was something in her. About a week went by and I hadnt heard from my Mom, which was strange. I called and she didnt answer and I stopped by because I was worried. She was home and had a guy there(he seemed pretty out there-she said he was a friend of her old female friend who had stayed with her before) turns out this guy was staying with her because she was scared to be alone. A couple days ago I get a call from my sister,my Moms neighbor had messaged her saying my Mom was taken by the police at 11am on Monday. Long story short my Mom had knocked on her neighbors door the night before and told her she was scared,asked to go look in her neighbors bathroom and then left. Her neighbor was half asleep and didnt really think too much into it but thought it was strange. The next morning my Mom buzzed her neighbors bell to get into the building and had 3 cops with her,my Mom had called the police saying there was someone in her apartment. The police went inside,said there was no one. My Mom told her neighbor and one of the officers that demons were following her and that the cops were fake and were going to kill her and to call 911. She got upset and the police took her to the hospital to get a psych eval. When her neighbor told us this she said her apartment was left unlocked her lights were still on and her kitten was still there alone. My husband and I went over to get the cat after hearing what happened and to close up the apartment,we got inside and her apartment was a disaster(hole in the wall in the bathroom,towels stuffed into the hole,cabinet was off,towel rack yanked out of the wall,etc. my husband walked into my Moms bedroom while I called my Sister to update her. He came out and was holding a pipe(we initially thought was for crack but now know it was for crystal meth). We called the police and an officer came and had me give him the pipe,he said the initial report noted they had seen drug paraphernalia in her unit and he was going to dispose of it. I asked if she was going to get charged and he said no because they couldn’t prove it was hers just that it was in her possession (still don’t understand why she wasn’t charged). I called the hospital and she was admitted,they couldn’t tell me anything because of HIPPA and my Mom signed the paper to not disclose her medical info with anyone. I asked to speak with my Mother and got through,she said she didnt remember any drug stuff being in her apartment,that she was framed and the guy drugged her and she heard him talking on the phone about framing her and that this is what “they” want-they being these “demons” for us to think she was using again and to think she had mental issues. She shared with me that the doctor told her she had opiod(her pain med),narcotic(one of her other meds),alcohol,weed and amphetamine in her blood. She denied anything with the pipe and still is saying days later she was framed and that theres a demon inside of her. She is being released today and Im a whirlwind of emotions,I dont want her to do this again and continue doing drugs or harm herself or others. 

My purpose in sharing that is for advice because as being her daughter its really affected my life and emotions. I realize now after talking to my sister that my Moms probably been back into drugs since last summer and was in a drug induced psychosis due to everything in her system. I love my Mom but I cant handle her heavy denial,lifestyle and lies anymore. She swore left and right that she didnt do any drugs that she was drugged by this guy and shes innocent. Im married now and want to enjoy my own happiness but its so hard with this happening. This is extremely long but it helped to get everything thats happened out.

I’m made it one more year. 12 years of good days and bad days and some close calls. Along the way I made some guidelines to keep me on the path. If they help anyone else then maybe I can save them years of trying to figure some of this out. If not and these are already obvious then you are smarter than me.



1. You have to want to quit.

All the self-help books and all the support groups in the world are not going to help you if you don’t actually want to quit.

2. Find a reason to quit.

Any reason outside of yourself that can make you accountable. Start small and build from there.

3. Redirect the the urge to something good. 

As an addict I have the superhuman ability to pour all of myself into something that gives me joy. Replacing the bad behaviors with something beneficial can help help while keeping you busy.

4. Never get bored.

I’m a machine of habit when I get bored I get back into whatever habit that’s easiest for me. 

5. If needed remove the people and things that allow you to continue the addiction. 

This one sucks. It hurts to lose someone that was close to you but when the people around you aren’t helping you then you need to think about what you really need to do and sometimes that means cutting people out. This goes for physical locations and inanimate objects as well.

6. Find anything that works for you.

What works for you may not help someone else. What works for me might seem alien and totally unreasonable to somebody else but as long as it keeps me clean then that’s what I need to do.


7. Get help if you need it.

You don’t have to do this alone. If you feel yourself falter or begin to fail there are thousands of people that know how to help and might even know exactly what you are going through.


You are all awesome.

You can do this.

Never be bored and never stop.

Good luck to all of you and Happy St. Patrick’s Day.",32,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42300367}"

(A really long rant, I'm sorry!)","I may be biased because I don't know many people except the ones from the methadone program, and if you've once been in a MMP it's like the whole city knows you and never forgets you. But I feel like I've never met so many adult people who belong to a certain group sharing similar traits indulging in so much shittalking about others. (By addicts I mean all the people that you typically encounter in a MMP engaging with each other, actively hanging around each other). IDK why, maybe the frustration, paired with the lack of activity so their hobby consists of hanging around and talking, and what is more interesting that guessing what Ronny did this afternoon? And so many prejudices and stereotypes, so much projecting. For example: every woman = prostitute. Obviously, how can a woman be addicted to opioids and NOT sell her body, right? Even if you meet a girl that's visibly too shy to talk to anyone, has social anxiety and is asexual, only takes prescription meds, it must be a prostitute, so bEwArE or she might steal your shit. (Nothing against sexworkers, I just notice many people using it in a derogatory manner to shittalk others.)  So many assumptions, like I get it that outsiders think you're a thief and a liar if you're addicted, but the group themselves should have more empathy?? Even with things like this: ""Your withdrawal can't be so bad, I did x for y long, and it's basically the same and it wasn't so bad"" bla bla, like WHEN DO YOU LEARN? Didn't this whole experience at least teach you not to judge somebodys pain unless you went through the exact same thing in the exact same body yourself?? Also, you can't win with these people (with no people on this planet tbh)..you must always be the bad one. They don't care how obviously wrong their assumptions are. E.g if someone is in a relationship, both of them are the bad guy. The woman is clearly using the man despite financially and emotionally assisting him, and the dude must clearly be abusive and a cheater even though nobody knows him and shouldn't judge. Just a few observations.. Although the misogyny is far outweighing the bad opinions about men I've personally heard amongst addicts.

Just yesterday old rumors from 5 years ago haunted me again. And somehow everybody meets everybody else to spread the shit, the most unlikeliest of people, after YEARS of you not engaging with them, happen to talk about you, as if there was nothing more important going on. I still to this day feel guilty and bad about it, but when I think about it, I don't even really know what for. I should be the one being mad, because I am the one who's being talked shit about for no reason for so many years. There was a guy I used to buy something from and at some point he apparently thought/decided we were together? I slept at his place for ONE single night, in his sisters room, because it was so far off in a rural area and I missed the last bus home, and why was I there in the first place? Because he made me feel like it was my obligation to, in turn for buying things, help him shoot up. I could understand the arguments that I was ""only taking advantage of him"" if it wasn't for the fact that I paid every dime for it correctly, full price as far as I was aware, unlike most of his ""friends"" who leeched off him. I never got shit gifted to me, hence I hate that saying ""ohh girls have it easy you got everything for free."" I never made it seem like I liked him or that we were together? It never even occurred to me that anyone could like me in that way back then, I always assumed I was his friend and he would just treat me like his other colleagues or at the very least like any other ""client"". And it's true, I only went to see him to buy stuff, but like.. idk why he would think otherwise? If he would've asked me I would've said that. I never made it seem like i was interested in anything else than buying his stuff and maybe helping him out because I'm that stupid a people pleaser, and overly polite/helpful which may send the wrong signals if you want it to, I'll admit that much. I never understood why women can't just buy stuff like any other male dude can go to his dealer. If you're a woman, exist, talk to people once in a leapyear and are too nice, you're fucked. Especially if you value privacy and respect other's and don't talk to everyone about private stuff, then everyone only knows the very one sided, often times completely made up stuff others say, and since they don't know you well there's even more room and fascination for speculation.

Anyhow, this rant got way too long, I'm sorry. I just hate myself so much for my past mistakes of interacting with anybody in any way, it always ends up horrible. And I hate myself for putting other people's perspective and memories and feelings above my own, that I'm so insecure and let everybody step on me. I hate being a woman, I hate being addicted to opioids, I hate shittalking others (but I will do it here, now, because I'm so sick of it all) and I hate people who shittalk. I hate it in general when somebody talks about stuff, with a confident CERTAINTY, stuff that they can't judge and don't know. Be it a scientific issue or a person they've never even been involved with. Maybe I'm just jealous about their self-assuredness. Be an adult and mind your own damn business. I hate that I instantly feel guilty and can't defend myself, my story or my boundaries. Someone could literally kick me and tell me it's my fault and I would forever feel guilty.

My dad has been living with an unusual marijuana addiction for a few years now, and we’re seeking help or guidance in planning for an intervention or treatment.
Several years ago, my dad was in a car accident that left him jobless (had to close his small business) and awaiting a settlement. Outside of the medical care he received, he also had prior chronic pain for which he was medicated with prescriptions. At some point, he decided to avoid the prescriptions and pick up marijuana. Unfortunately, he became severely addicted along the way. He went from a seemingly normal person to mentally unstable. He discovered social media and a pod of like-minded only stoners who enable him. He spends all day smoking and posting videos of it, and spends all of his money on marijuana memorabilia to use in the videos. He believes he has “business” opportunities as an “influencer,” but isn’t focused enough to monetize. He also does not have a job, as he’s dependent on a legal settlement which is rapidly decreasing. He’s irrational, angry, forgetful, and unable to complete tasks due to lack of focus despite still being very high energy. We’re hoping to get him help as soon as possible, especially before he harms himself, or wastes what little savings he has left for retirement.

They offered drugs like weed and cocaine and I took them at parties and got high. I liked the high feeling. I was able to moderate. However inside myself I had felt the urge to be my true self. I was born a man and wanted so much to be a woman. Since I was little I had feelings like I wanted to be a woman. However at that point I couldn't. It was the 90s and 1 thing led to another and I was married to a woman I thought I had loved. We had our first kid together unexpectedly and so we married. A marriage upon further reflection of convenience rather than love. Then we had twins in 2001 which we didn't expect either. However in about 2002, the feelings of dysphoria were seeping into my body harder than ever before. My marriage was falling apart. Everything it seemed to me was falling apart. I was living a lie. A lie that had sucked everyone I had ever known in with it. My addiction disease began to affect me more than ever. It was a disease. I was medicating my gender dysphoria instead of with estrogen, with drugs like heroin and meth. I needed to take more and more drugs in order to feel right. To not feel the pain of being a failed ""father"" of being a failed ""husband"", a failed ""son"". There were days I felt like killing myself. I didn't see my kids very much. Every time I would see a picture of them I would cry because I had failed them. I kept taking more and more drugs. Being around bad guys. In relationships and when I was buying these drugs. In late 2007 I almost died from a heroin overdose and I set off to make myself clean. I went to therapy and began transitioning initially to female. However 3 weeks in I heard that my trans friend was killed. I became scared out of my mind in pain because I thought I could never be my true self. I stopped taking hormones. I started taking heroin and meth again. More and more I went. In a way I was trying to kill myself. I didn't want to live anymore. In early 2012 I almost died again from heroin. I thought about a lot of things after that. I decided that I didn't want to be under the influence of drugs anymore. I wasn't going to let my life be defined by drugs. I got clean. 9 years since I have taken heroin, meth or cocaine. From time to time Ive smoked weed but not often. In 2014 I began my transition to female and didn't look back. Today I go by Dawn and I am a resilient woman. Addiction is a ruthless disease. Thats what it was to me. A cancer. Beat the disease. Dont let it control your life.

this article is about the loneliness of addiction, it examines the how & why and offers different ways of coping, including perspective and awareness. 

&#x200B;

We have spent much of our addictions ***alone***, some of us finding solace in addiction ***because*** we were alone, and we will have to learn how to introduce or reintroduce ourselves into society, one relationship at a time. This article, as well as [Addicts & Teamwork](https://rcs001.wordpress.com/takes-a-village/), explore the impact of feeling lonely and what can be done about it as well as the importance of learning how to once again work as a team, how to benefit from and contribute to our communities, and how to rebuild some of the relationships that we have either neglected or outright destroyed. It’s important to our mental and physical health, it’s important to our recovery and it’s important to our future.

This article helps to explain why.

Let’s discuss ***loneliness***. We all know what loneliness is, we’ve each experienced it somehow at some point in our lives, in our own way, and we know that it’s a completely natural reaction to certain situations and circumstances. We also know that just because we are alone – we all feel alone sometimes, too – does not mean that we are *lonely* – there is a difference.

Although the two can often go hand-in-hand, simply being alone is not the same as being lonely, right? Being alone is when we are by ourselves, no one else in the office or the room or the car, it is our uninhibited time, when we can walk around the house naked, sing aloud to our favorite songs, it is our quiet time, time to think and to consider, to imagine, to do our work. For most of us, alone time is necessary, at least in spurts. We use it to clear our minds, we use it to figure things out, we use it to break free and play, we use it to concentrate and focus. Sometimes, we would rather be alone, doing our own thing than having to put on our faces and join the crowds. Some of us have a lot of anxiety when it comes to social gatherings and events, some of us don’t like company at all. To all of us, being alone is a *choice*, and therein lies the main difference between the two.

Loneliness is one of the most powerfully negative feelings we are capable of. We *choose* to be alone, few of us *choose* to be lonely. Loneliness ruins our confidence and our self-esteem, it’s mentally and emotionally taxing and exhausting as well as confusing and fickle. Loneliness multiplies exponentially in our lives and before long creates its own distances and fulfills itself. Loneliness, especially prolonged loneliness, is serious and can even be dangerous, it can cause serious mental and physical health problems.

&#x200B;

>“Loneliness has been linked with a higher risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. It has been shown to influence our genes and our immune systems, and even recovery from breast cancer,” says [Dr. Julianna Holt-Lunstad, BYU](https://fhssfaculty.byu.edu/FacultyPage?id=jh67), expert in social and social isolation studies. “There is now robust evidence of the protective effects of social relationships both on morbidity and on mortality.”

&#x200B;

Loneliness is a *state,* a consistent state of solitude, where our experiences and feelings or emotions are not shared, where we’ve no one to talk to, to counter us or to *observe*  us. Without this, we’ve no one to affirm us, either. This makes it easy for our confidence to take a nose-dive and doesn’t take long to rile up our anxieties and insecurities. 

Loneliness is a sadness, a longing, an awareness of not having any close or even many cordial relationships. Going through life with no one to share it with can turn things cold and empty. Experiences are not remembered as fondly or as strongly. Love and joy cannot be shared. Grief and sadness cannot be shared.

When we are lonely for a while, when we go long enough without being able to share our feelings, we begin to internalize them, and sometimes those feelings can get so strong and so negative that we start to wish them away but all we can do is run from them. When we do this, when we don’t take responsibility for our feelings, when we ignore them or we try to argue them away, when we bury them beneath mounds of pills and gallons of alcohol we don’t realize that we are creating vast internal distances. We start to inevitably feel further and further away from our feelings, and in turn, from ourselves. This disconnection on the inside translates into distance outside, we push ourselves from our friends and family, eventually what becomes varying degrees of social isolation which can cause depression, anxiety, sleep and appetite interruptions. It certainly causes stress. Loneliness can take a physical toll on your body, too, it can lead to health complications and illness.

&#x200B;

>“Social isolation \[and\] loneliness have a significant and equivalent effect on risk for mortality, which exceeds the risk associated with obesity,” [says Dr. Holt-Lunstad](https://academic.oup.com/ppar/article/27/4/127/4782506). “Those who are isolated are at increased risk for depression, cognitive decline, and dementia.  There is also substantial evidence that social relationships have a direct influence on health-relevant physiology such as blood pressure, immune functioning, and inflammation.”

Because of all this, we also all know that loneliness can destroy us, it can turn so sour so quickly that it takes over our lives, proliferates from the inside out, bleeding on any and every relationship we may have. In fact, a lot of us have turned to addictions *because* of our loneliness, because we’d been looking for an escape, and in that may already feel particularly destroyed. But loneliness can be *helped*, it can be forgiven, it can be made positive. We can learn to trust again. We have to.

As addicts, we are familiar with loneliness and the problems that it can cause. We often feel alone because we had liked to use alone, and so we have worked hard at having ample alone-time for using, which in recovery can be a hard gap to fill. Maybe we feel alone because we don’t trust anyone enough to warrant any sort of relationships, because we don’t trust *ourselves* enough. Maybe we just feel misunderstood, or that no one is capable of understanding. Maybe we feel alone because, for whatever reason, we have pushed  everyone so far away that it’s hard to see them, anymore. Maybe we feel abandoned, even, by our friends or family and loved ones. There are as many different reasons for feeling lonely as there are reasons for being alone, as there are each of us. The result is usually the same.

We are, as addicts, by our nature introverted. We are often unsociable, withdrawn. We innately  build up walls that shut out the rest of the world, walls that we can later find nearly impossible to break down. We push people away, we [lie to them](https://rcs001.wordpress.com/isolation/). We recluse into ourselves and close ourselves off completely.  Sometimes, this can go on for years. However, a part of recovery is opening up and letting in some light, tearing down some walls and rebuilding relationships, including your own relationship with yourself, and this can be a long and painful process.

People – human beings – the animals that we are – were not meant to live life alone.

This regards the unique types of pain that addicts can feel, and the way that inevitable isolation can affect us, it offers a bit of understanding, comradery, and perspective. Sometimes that stuff can help.

ADDICTION'S PAIN

My mother has multiple sclerosis. With her disease comes chronic physical and emotional pain. She talks to me about it sometimes, when she can find the words, and one of the things that she says the most often is that she feels *alone*. Even though I am by her side, even though I try my hardest to be with her, to encourage her, to *help* her, to be her friend and her confidant, I can’t deny that she *is* alone. I can only be of so much comfort and distraction, but I can never be company to her pain. I cannot personally relate to the kind of pain that she feels, I do not fully understand it, and even if I did I cannot share her experiences with it. Though together we can share laughter and joy and even sadness, her pain is hers and hers alone.

And my pain – our pain – the pain of an addict – is ours and ours alone. At least *this* is something that we can understand.

“Nothing is quite so isolating, ” says Robert Murphy, professor at Columbia University, in his memoir, [*The Body Silent*](http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/view/1705), which narrates his struggles with paralyzing cancer, “as the knowledge that when one hurts, nobody else feels the pain; that when one sickens, the malaise is a private affair.”

Innately, pain is of the loneliest things that we might experience in our lifetime. Emotional pain, physical pain, spiritual pain – at some point, pain is just plain *pain*. People may be able to relate, they may be able to swap similar stories and share in some personal experiences, but pain is private, it is itself unshareable, it is loud but heard only by us, solid and hard but seen and felt only by us. Pain can become so cumbersome that it no longer allows for hobbies or for friends or family. It can cause us to isolate ourselves, to withdraw, to indeterminately halt the things that we enjoy like hanging out with friends, golfing, going shopping or to the cinema.

Acknowledging pain is the body’s first step in responding to it, in trying to make it better. When we burn our hand we notice that every available resource at our disposal is immediately honed in to that particular part of our body. It hurts, physically, and that is what first draws our attention. The pain lets us know that something is wrong. Once we know that something is wrong, we can try to figure out what it is, then we can devise some sort of rectifying plan. Damage control. Healing. As addicts, much of our pain is emotional, coming from the inside. So, instead of turning to friends or family for help, we instinctively turn inward, focusing on what’s wrong. We focus on the pain because we are trying to protect and to treat ourselves. It’s natural, it’s what is supposed to happen. Note: how we handle or deal with that pain is a totally different story.

However severe our pain may be on the inside, it is nearly invisible on the outside. People – your friends and family – may be able to see the symptoms of pain, such as bleeding from a wound, wincing, groaning, crying, cradling a sprained wrist, but they cannot see how it makes you *feel*, they cannot see the emotional and mental aspects that make the pain truly what it is. This barrier causes inevitable doubt, especially when there is no direct, obvious evidence of the pain such as with neuropathic diseases like fibromyalgia or migraines. And so, the gap between the sufferer and the witness broadens.

Acute pain is different. With acute pain, such as from an injury or wound, we may be holed up for some time while we heal but we will be able to reclaim our lives once the wound has been treated and the pain has subsided. With chronic pain, we don’t have the same luxury, we don’t know that the pain will go away and we don’t know that we will ever be able to move on. This can cause a lot of extra anxiety and depression, on top of what we had already been feeling, and this mental toll is a vastly underappreciated feature of persistent, lingering pain. This is the pain that my mother feels. This is the kind of pain that addicts feel.

Now, we each feel our own pain in our own way, and we each deal with that pain in our own way. Different things cause different pain to each of us, different sensations and different levels. A fractured finger may be excruciating to a little girl, but a hardened war veteran might not even notice the exact same injury. A fight with your boyfriend might land you in a gallon of ice cream, sobbing, wishing for the end of the world while he’s out partying like nothing happened, even though you both withstood the same fight. This can make it especially difficult to connect to anyone else, even other people in pain. 

As addicts, we *feel* alone because we *are* *alone*, insomuch as our addictions’ reach. We sometimes withdraw from our social lives and instead rather enjoy as much isolation as possible so that we can sit and suffer in peace. The pain we feel inevitably divides us from our friends and family, it causes doubt, confusion, and misunderstanding. We feel like the pain may never end and with an unforetold duration, we start to believe that it won’t – that it *can’t*. The depression and anxiety caused by anticipating the rest of our lives spent this way is another sort of unique pain – one we can just add to the pile. Each addict treks this journey, but each addict finds his or her own path and no two travel the same.

ADDICTION'S ISOLATION

We all eventually reach a point in our addiction where we dose for maintenance purposes only. We dose to get out of bed, we dose to go to work, we dose while at work. We dose to feel stabilized, like we are normal. We don’t necessarily get high, but we do feel better. During this phase we try to carry on as normally as possible, as much as possible, for as long as possible. We socialize, we go out in public and we go to work or we go shopping, we go out to eat or we go to a friend’s house. We try to act and seem as if we are “normal,” as if we are the same as everyone else, as if nothing is wrong. Sometimes, because of this, we can feel as if we are cloaked, wearing this as a disguise, separated from the rest of the world by a heavy black line. We feel alone even when we are in a crowded room. And that’s because we *are* alone, we have inadvertently separated ourselves from everyone else by the lies that we tell while we pretend to be okay. We are suffering an addiction but pretending that we are not, therefor everyone thinks that we are as okay as we can muster up the act. It’s a lie. And lies divide us. 

As it is addict nature, most of us end up living a life of secrecy, in a world of faked smiles and rehearsed conversation. We pretend to be okay when we are not, we pretend our addiction isn’t there – but it is, always. Because of this, things can start to feel different – nothing feels real, anymore, and everything seems to  have been tainted by lies. We lie to our friends and family about our addiction – the severity of it, its existence at all – we lie to *ourselves*. We lie every time we say we are okay, we lie every time we smile and laugh on the outside when we are not smiling or laughing on the inside.

Lies keep us segregated, and every lie we tell pushes us further and further apart from whomever we are lying to. When we lie, we draw that heavy divisional line where in one world – in your world – there is a lie, but in the other world – in your friend’s world – there is no lie. After a short while, no matter your attempts to hide it, those closest to you will be able to sense the distance. And they will wonder, and they will ask, and you will lie some more and tell them that everything is fine. The distance will grow until even those closest to you are eventually gone.

This distance can appeal to those of us struggling in our relationships and in our social lives because of our addictions. We’re embarrassed by our situation or circumstances, we are self-conscious and hyper self-aware, we are so afraid of judgment that we would rather not be seen in public than force ourselves to face the crowds of whispering, gawking spectators. Sometimes we may even take further steps to isolate ourselves. It makes lying easier, it makes connections more difficult. Alone, we don’t have to worry about faking it. Alone, we don’t have to worry about what someone else is thinking about us. Alone, we don’t have anyone to lie to but ourselves. 

You withdraw from your social life, you don’t spend as much time with friends or family, work starts to suffer. You are instead rather alone, by yourself, just you and your darkness. I get it – it’s darkness, but it’s *your* darkness. You are familiar with it, you know what to expect from it, you don’t have anyone to explain anything to, you don’t have to put up a front of any kind – you can relax into your suffering easily and peacefully.  Maybe you’re comfortable just sitting there alone for the rest of your life. Maybe you don’t like this solitary style, maybe you’re pleading for change. Certainly, either way, you understand that this darkness – this hiding and isolation and these secrets and lies – is not conducive of recovery. 

Maybe since we can’t trust ourselves we can’t trust anyone else, either. Maybe it’s the appreciation of knowing that no one can understand our pain. Or, maybe we’re too self-conscious, too embarrassed, abashedly apologetic. Whatever the excuse, total seclusion – where you’ve locked yourself away from anyone and everyone, including friends or parents or even your children – has no advantage. Being a loner is one thing, lots of addicts are by their very nature loners, but being fearful or unable to be social is something else.

There isn’t much to be done about *pain*. If it hurts, whatever it is it’s going to hurt. Symptomatic treatment can help, medications can sometimes help, it depends on the type of pain, if its emotional or spiritual or mental or physical, the location of pain on the body, your own personal genetic makeup and history, etc. etc. The real help, the only kind that can really make any changes, must come from the inside. Period. You will benefit the most by actively seeking help – from the desire to get better or to recover: the root of your search for healing. This desire is in you – the desire to get better, to recover, or to offer help to those in need of healing – else why have you almost finished reading this article?

Even if all you seek is a shoulder to lean on, breaking your cycle of solitude and isolation is one of the biggest steps in your recovery – letting someone else in, a friend or a family member, a doctor or a therapist – or, at least, letting yourself out. Talk to someone, and let someone listen to you. Listen to them and solicit their opinions, their advice, their ideas. This is admittedly one of the most difficult steps you will need to take, especially breaking free from your comfortable darkness that you have become used to. Stepping outside of your own set boundaries might seem scary, but only for that first step – once you take it, you realize how easy it actually was and tha*t* the true horror *is behind you.*",5,{'symptomatic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.51179993}"

[Here's the original post](http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/461215-Amphetamine-The-Drug-You-Learn-to-Hate).

I would like to, create a reference point (not only for addicts, but also future addicts and spectators as well) for the process of amphetamine addiction developing in the mind - mainly by noting what effects dwindle at what phases, and what effects become prominent at what stages. This is all mostly through self-experience although I am also researching a bit on the topic.

Amphetamine (and its derivatives) are unique from most other drugs. The effects of amphetamine work in discrete stages, and some effects may continue while other effects wear off.

A user develops tolerance to amphetamine in different ways than he would develop tolerance to say, opiates or benzos. Amphetamine tolerance is not caused by an increase of corresponding receptors, but instead it is mainly caused by depletion of the neurotransmitters it releases (dopamine, norepinephrine, and some serotonin) and also because amphetamine is neurotoxic (not only will the amphetamine molecule itself cause neuron damage, but the oxidation resulting from the metabolism of neurotransmitters reaches abnormally high levels and can kill neurons. Also, an increased body temperature can increase the potential for neuron death.) Amphetamine tolerance can also indirectly be the product of lack of sleep and poor nutrition. Amphetamine tolerance has many more factors which play in to it than traditional drugs. Some users find that with responsible usage, they can delay amphetamine tolerance indefinitely. Other users find that tolerance can be accumulated rapidly from just one period of binge usage.

The effects of amphetamine do not remain constant either; the effects transform into different types of effects over time. Some effects disappear, and sometimes new effects set in. Because of this, prolonged amphetamine use seems like it can be illustrated as working in phases or stages.

Note: The Cause of transitioning to further stages (past the first 2) is usually caused by factors such as Lack of sleep, Malnutrtion, Sedentary Lifestyle, or simply because the dose is too large.

**Stage 1 of Amphetamine Use** - During this stage, amphetamine will be at its hedonic peak; the pleasure of taking amphetamine will not get any higher from this point on. The most notable feelings are a ""lovey"" feeling, powerful euphoria, increased motivation, deep philosophical thinking, strong feelings of ""lust"", etc.

Length of phase: 

1-3 days with binge usage; 

5-10 days with daily usage; 

About 5-15 uses total if used sparingly with atleast several days inbetween doses.

Characteristic Effects of this Stage:

* Powerful euphoria

* Empathy and socialability

* Overwhelming amount of increased motivation

**Stage 2 of Amphetamine Use** - During this stage, the ""lovey"" and empathetic feelings of amphetamine quickly fade, although the ""pleasurable"" feelings of euphoria and increased motivation are still present. The decrease in empathetic feelings is likely responsible from a depletion of serotonergic vesicles. Most users note that it is impossible to transition back to ""Stage 1"" at this point, no matter how long of a break a person takes from amphetamine. This suggests that a permanent tolerance develops for the empathetic effects of the drug - whether this occurs from a psychological acclimation to the effects, or from physiological reasons, I don't know. This is the stage which doctors aim for when prescribing amphetamine for medicinal use with ADD and ADHD. This stage can be prolonged for quite some time (and if the dose is low enough, some medical professionals say that this phase can be prolonged indefinitely) this is assuming of course that the user continuously maintains an adequate amount of high quality sleep (7+ hours a night), proper nutrition, and a non-sedentary lifestyle.

Length of Stage: 

1-7 days with binge usage (note that binge usage is defined by immediately taking another dose once the effects of one dose wear off or begin to wear off, interrupting sleep in the process). 

2 Weeks to 6+ Months if used daily (and maintaining a healthy lifestyle). Indefinitely if used sparingly (with 3-5+ days inbetween uses).

Characteristic Effects of this Stage:

* Increased Motivation

* Slight Euphoria

**Stage 3 of Amphetamine Use, the ""Tool"" phase** - At this point, most if not all empathetic effects of usage have diminished. This point is characterized by the fact that amphetamine becomes the sole motivator for tasks, hence the nickname ""The Tool Phase"" because amphetamine is now used as a Tool for accomplishment. The negative physiological effects (the ""body load"") become more prominent.

Length of Stage: 

At this point, it is hard to define the length it will take to transition from one stage to the next. Some users will find that if they take breaks from their usage or just lower their dose, they can go backwards to earlier stages. Some binge users may even rapidly progress through the stages, possibly even skipping to the final ones or developing psychosis.

Characteristic Effects of this stage:

* Period of 'positive effects' and period of 'negative effects' from taking a dose begin to merge. (usually, if negative effects are present they only follow after the positive effects wear off)

* The user needs amphetamine to stay at/above a baseline level of motivation, and when amphetamine is not in effect the user is below a baseline level of motivation.

* In order for a task to be done effeciently, the user finds that they need to be on amphetamine.

* The level of euphoria decreases to a point where it is no more significant than the level of euphoria which most people get from daily life without amphetamine.

**Stage 4 of Amphetamine Use, ""The Decline""** - The efficiency of amphetamine as a ""Tool"" begins to drop significantly, and this stage is characterized by the ""comedown"" (the period of negative effects after the drug begins to wear off) becoming much stronger. The ""comedown"" may even begin to merge in with the period of positive effects. At this point, the body load may begin to become painful.

Characteristic Effects of this Stage:

* Painful body load (Muscle Pain, High Blood Pressure, Inadequate Circulation, Dehydration, Malnutrition, deterioration of the skin and other tissues, etc).

* Depression

* Severe Anxiety


**Stage 5 of Amphetamine Use, The Procrastination** - This Stage may or may not be experienced by amphetamine users. In this stage, the positive effects of amphetamine are almost absent if not completely gone, and the ""coming up"" of a dose of amphetamine is subsequently followed by an immediate barrage of negative effects (both physiological and psychological). The reason this phase is called ""The Procrastination"" is because the user forgets how unbearable the negative sensations are (due to amphetamine compromising the brain's ability to efficiently make memories, especially goal-orientated memories); by the next day, even though the user may have told himself to not take amphetamine, he takes amphetamine again anyways (due to the brain not being able to make a goal-orientated memory, the brain was unable to produce counter-motivation to stop the user from taking more amphetamine the next day). This might possibly be the most psychologically painful and strenuous phase for the amphetamine user, since he is unable to figure out why he keeps taking amphetamine even though he clearly knows it only causes him pain.

Characteristic Effects:

* Repeatedly taking amphetamine despite knowledge that it no longer gives the desired effects, and only causes negative effects.

**Stage 6 of Amphetamine Use, Irritability and Pessimism** - This phase is characterized by extreme irritability. The user begins forgetting the drug is responsible for his negative feelings, and begins to blame things in the environment around them instead. The user begins to think that other people are responsible for how poorly he/she feels. The user might show hostility, or social withdrawal. The user also begins to develop an extremely pessimistic attitude towards life.

Characteristic Effects of this Stage:

* Acute Depression

* Severe Anxiety

* Irritability, even when the drug is out of the user's system

* Psychosis

* Inability to Sleep

* Severe Restlessness

* lack of willpower

* Inability to find ""the right choice of words""

* Obsessive Thinking

**Stage 7 of Amphetamine use, Nihilism and Dissociation** - During this phase, incidences of psychosis begin to emerge (if they haven't already) even if the drug user has been maintaining an adequate amount of sleep. The user usually becomes nihilistic, thinking that nothing in life matters or has meaning. Some users may even become solipsistic, which means they think that they are the only things which are real in the world. Solipsism is often accompanied by paranoia, or thinking that others only have the intention of harming the solipsistic individual. If the user had obtained any philosophical or metacognitive methods of thinking during the earlier stages of amphetamine use, those same metacognitive methods begin to eat away at the person's psyche. They feel as if they are helpless to do anything besides sit back and watch their mind become unravelled. Even if the user realizes that his irritable attitude towards other people isn't how he truly feels, he is unable to manage his irritability (most likely due to a complete diminishment of serotonin, as well as the brain's ability to make memories being compromised). The individual's ego may begin to deconstruct itself, and the user may have a feeling that they completely lack any willpower to do anything. This stage is also accompanied by a large amount of confusion.

Characteristic Effects of this stage:

* Confusion

* Paranoia

* Unbearable Depression and Anxiety

* Delusions

* Increased Incidences of Psychosis

* Increasingly Painful Body Load

* Lack of willpower

* Cognition become confusing and incoherent. Users often claim things like their mind is ""too loud"", ""jumping to false conclusions"", or ""doesn't make sense"" and the user feels helpless to control this.

* Panic Attacks become very prominent

* Feelings of Deja Vu

* If weight loss was experienced in beginning stages, it may come to a hault or even reverse into weight gain

* Inability to experience pleasure

* Akathisia

* Feelings that an individual no longer has ""free will""

* Difficult to form coherent sentences and speak properly. Similar to ""Clanging"" or ""Word Salad"" experienced in schizophrenics.

**Stage 7b ""Letting Go / Giving Up""** - This stage is not always experienced, but in some instances after the user has experienced an excruciating and unbearable amount of anxiety and mental stress, he may experience a period of ""Letting Go"" in which the brain gives up on constructing/maintaining its deluded psychological structures. The negative effects of the drug temporarily fade, and the user has a ""moment of peace"". This temporary phase usually only lasts several hours (if not less) before the user returns to phase 7. Since the brain during this phase has completely abandoned any attempts to make goal orientated behaviour, the user may find it difficult (or simply not want to) to take care of themselves. However, during this phase, the user will find that they will actually be able to get to sleep, and they should take advantage of this temporary somnia to get sleep. I do not know what neurological mechanisms are responsible for this phase; it is almost as if it is the brain's last resort - to enter a careless and stressless stupor. Perhaps the brain releases endorphins in response to the unbearable anxiety?

Characteristic Effects:

* Stupor
* Irresponsiveness

* Carelessness

* Ironically, if effects of ""word salad"" or ""clanging"" were experienced in stage 7, they are no longer as present in stage 7b.

**Stage 8, ""The Stupor"", Brain Damage** - In this stage, amphetamine no longer gives effects, and the brain's desire for taking amphetamine (even if taking it has become a habit) begins to drop. As long as amphetamine use continues, the user makes no progress towards recovery of any sort. The individual is unresponsive and disconnected. Amphetamine has a tendency to make the user put too much effort into anything/everything, and this gives the brain not a single moment of psychological ""rest"" (where the individual doesn't think deeply). However, during this phase, it is quite the opposite - the individual's mind is in a prolonged state of resting and won't even follow through with the very act of thinking if the thought takes too much effort to think. During this phase, the user may have a steep decline in intelligence.

Characteristic Effects:

* Prolonged episodes of stupor and carelessness

* Lethargy

* Diminished Intelligence and mental efficiency
* Irreversible Psychological Damage

* Possible brain damage

* The individual may develop a ""permanent stuttering"" which persists even after amphetamine has long since been ceased.

* In a similar way that the stuttering develops, an individual may develop a possible permanent difficulty talking, using correct grammar and sentence structure, or expressing thoughts to others. In severe cases, this may even resemble a schizophrenic's clanging or word salad.

* Essentially, the mind at this point is irreversibly compromised. The user's personality might have changed permanently. The individual may be much more easily irritated for the rest of his/her life. Cognitive functioning will never work the same as it used to. Although the user may make improvements and greatly recover, it will almost always seem like something ""isn't right"" in the mind, or that something is ""missing"". Individuals will still be able to lead fulfilling lives, and some may make amazing recoveries where they feel normal again like they did before they ever began using. Unfortunately, in severe cases, the individual may never be the same again.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48004678}"
2021-03-15 12:05:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m5o0uw/what_vice_to_use/,What vice to use?,"Hey guys, just got on this subreddit. I’m an artist who turned 24 a month ago and I had a pretty bad depressive episode over that weekend because I kind of had the realization of “wow, I’m not where I thought I’d be at this point. I’m still at my shitty job and I’m not doing what I’m passionate about full time yet.” I struggle with depression so I feel the situations I get in in my life end up being harder to cope with than they are for most so I tend to cope with my shit with weed and alcohol. On both sides of my family I have relatives that struggle with addiction of some kind so I feel that it’s kind of in my DNA. 

I’m a singer and a musician who has asthma and about a week ago I felt the smoking was causing problems with my lungs that were getting in the way of my singing so I got rid of my weed and switched over to edibles. I feel that that helped with the weed addiction because I needed to be more patient with getting a high from that and it made me less inclined to do that so much, but I’ve been drinking more because of it. Also I just smoked a cigarette (something I do maybe a handful of times each year) and it’s not like I think I suddenly have an addiction to nicotine but that’s not another vice that I want to pick up. 

I guess my question is, when you feel that you need some kind of vice to take place of your addiction, what’s a healthier option? While I hate to admit it, quitting cold turkey seems daunting at this point. How do I ween myself off of this alcohol addiction?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7178151}"

Ultimately I wanted to get off for cheaper life insurance and reduced side effects from the meds them self.

I had gone on my longest and most emotionally deteriorating binge thus far. 33 days of daily use, undernourishment, and sleep deprivation. I was experiencing just unbearable physical, mental, and emotional side effects. Auditory and visual hallucinations, formication, full body pain, paranoia. After a month of pushing my body and mind to the limit, I finally gave up. I wasn’t getting the high anymore that I so desperately craved. I was just destroying myself at this point. I was picking at my skin, I was down nearly 20lbs, my face looked sunken in, and I couldn’t trust my brain anymore. So I stopped smoking dope.

I made it a full 11 days before relapsing. The worst part of relapse for me is the fact that my decision is a conscious one. I know I shouldn’t go and buy dope, but I don’t stop myself. I waited nights to buy a bag. I made sure to hold onto my money for 3 days so I could buy dope. February 28th, I bought a ball from a plug I'd never used before and got ripped off. Rookie fucking mistake. Salt mixed up with ice, no cool man. Copped a new baggie and I was out of dope 3 days later. Fuck, I dont want to be sober.

My roommate was selling me 2mg xanax bars for $2.50 a pop. I spent my only $8 on 3 bars. Anything to disconnect from reality for a while. I did Xanax 3 days in a row, putting myself and my partner through emotional distress, including multiple suicide attempts and breakups. Fuck Xanax, I hate what it’s doing to me. I'm done with this shit. This was March 7th.

After 3 whopping days of sobriety, I decide to buy 4 more bars of Xanax after receiving $10 cash for doing a favor for a friend. I was having a hard time sleeping and talked myself into buying Xanax to put me out and of course bought way more than I would’ve needed for that purpose. Stupid fucking addicted brain. I did those Xanax for 2 days. On the second day, I was sexually taken advantage of by my roommate. Raped while too barred out to resist. How fucking pathetic and it RUINED ME. I didn't touch Xanax after this. I still had a whole bar left and I didn’t do it and threw it out.

After waking up from the Xanax haze and realizing what I had let happen, I was so ashamed of myself. I couldn’t look my partner in the eyes and I felt so empty and so unsafe in my home, our home. I picked up my best friend and had her stay with me all day so I didn’t spend my money on dope and I wasn’t home alone again with my roommate/abuser. We got super stoned and hung out at my apartment all day long. We hung out in the living room because my bedroom was a disaster. Every time my roommate left his room, he kept flirting with us and hinting at us hooking up with him. He would stand and stare at us, giving us awkward eye contact, I felt very uncomfortable in my house and this persisted throughout the evening, and got even worse when it was my roommate and HIS FRIEND trying to fuck my friend and I.

Later that night, my friend and I had talked ourselves into dropping acid together. We both figured it would be fun and it’d keep my money from being spent on meth or anything worse. My partner passed out on my friend and I, and had his nephew stay the night to “trip sit” us. THIS SUCKED. Midway through my trip, I begin to notice I’m having some soreness in my throat and begin to connect a few pieces in my brain. I can’t say anything about it out loud, not while my partner's nephew is listening at least. I am going insane inside my brain. What if my sore throat is STD related? He didn’t wear a condom and I never took a Plan B. Oh my god, my partner is going to find out. AT this point, I began to spiral. The entire trip, I am fearful of my roommate and highly paranoid. I ask him to leave quietly for the night with his guest, after LOW-KEY freaking out on him for giving me an STD.

This alleviated SO MUCH OF MY ANXIETY AND STRESS. I would finally feel safe in my house again. I opened up to my family and my partner about the abuse I suffered at the hands of my roommate. I opened up about my recent drug use. I opened up about needing help and being ready to get sober and start my life over.

Today makes me clean from Methamphetamine 12 days.

And clean off the Xanax for 4 days.

See our relationship started when we were both heavy drinkers. I eventually quot drinking and turned to other drugs whether they be otc or off the streets. Dxm was my go to. But oh God I loved me some percs and dope or whatever my dealer gave me. He just called it dope. But aside from the fact that we were both addicts in the beginning, we clicked so fast and so well. Its been almost 2 years together and the only real arguments we have ever had were about drugs or alcohol. We are just perfect for each other honestly. Our relationship was great for the first year (almost) and eventually I had to move out of town to another state with my father. We were still together the whole time. During this time I found the ""miracle drug"" DXM. From the first dose I loved it so much. I still remember it was the super bowl of 2020 when I first used dxm. I stole it from our local dollar store since I was broke. Eventually I moved back to the state my boyfriend lived in and we both moved into a friends house with my brother. This is when I learned about triple c. And this quickly became my goto. Since it was so cheap at my job and so easily accessible. I lost 30 pounds in around 1 month when I started taking them every day. Then once the r30 dropped I stopped ccc and took them instead since they were cheaper and stronger/safer. And thats when it all went downhill completely.  At first it was 5 pills every 4 or so hours, next it was 8every 4 hours then 10, then 12, then 14, then I went to rehab. But before I went to rehab I made sure to save some for when I got back. Because I didn't really wanna get clean. And so I came back, relapsed and my addiction got worse. Now I'm calling out of work sick because I am to high to get out of bed or do anything. And yet I said ""babe if you want this relationship to work YOU need to go to rehab for your alcoholism."" And so he went. But the whole time guess what I did? I got high every day he was in there. And every day he called me and I told him I'm proud of him. I was and I am, but I was so happy that he did that for me yet I took it as a joke. I didn't care. And so I kept lying and telling him that everything was okay. But really It wasn't and I was still getting high while I forced him to get sober. And it tore me up inside. I started whoring around because I stopped caring about myself. I got scammed for drugs because I was too high to realize how dumb the scammers were at the time. And honestly what makes me hate doing drugs now is the feeling of guilt that comes with it every time. The feeling that I was too pathetic to say no when my partner spent his savings to go to the best rehab we could afford. And I'm a piece of shit girlfriend because I didn't even try and stop while he was in there. And I love the fuck out of him. And he loves the shit put of me too.  We were made for each other from the beginning. We are soulmates. Yet he gave it his all and I gave it nothing. So when he finally got back. I told him that I used every day while he was away and how I stashed some away so I could take some while he was at work or wherever he goes. And we threw them out. And we cried. And we had sex and talked for a while and I think everything's going to be okay as long as we both push forward together and stay strong.",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7167364}"

She’s been making progress but unfortunately her insurance is about to run out and she’s going to be released. After speaking with her mother, we agree that going home is risky. She needs to get out of the environment where there will be triggers or any opportunity to buy anything. 
Luckily I’m in a position where I can take her away. My family has a cabin on top of a mountain in the absolute middle of nowhere. So the day she gets out we’re leaving. She’s been there with me before, loved it and is excited to go back. We have all the time to spend in the perfect environment for recovery and some self love.

I feel like depressants wouldn’t do her any good. However I do think that it’s okay if she smokes weed. Personally I don’t smoke cause it makes me paranoid. But I plan on bringing some just for her. What are your feelings on other vices such as booze or weed when recovering from something far worse like heroine or fentanyl? I’m also convinced that the longer I can keep her away the better chance she has of not relapsing. What can I do to convince we to stay longer? Or at least not go back? I’ve also heard of people getting into extreme sports to replace drugs. Has anyone here tried that? What has helped you or a loved one to overcome addiction?

I’m a big believer in second chances and not defying people about their past so I continued the relationship. 

Throughout the entity of our relationship he would glamorize his past drug use. He would take melatonin by the bunch-full. Or any PM pill to aid him in “sleeping”. It seemed like a little much. He would get defensive if brought to his attention. Also gambled a lot, not sure if this is helpful information. 

Fast forward to August- he didn’t need to piss clean in a cup anymore and immediately resumed drinking and smoking weed. I’m not a person who minds weed. He was constantly high off marijuana. As long as he was awake, he was high on some sort weed. Again, didn’t bother me. 

Fast forward to December. He had gotten into an argument with his father. He went out with his buddies and took a Xanax that night. Me, trying to be a good partner, aided him until he sobered up. He confessed to me that he knew going into the night that he would be taking a Xanax. 

He also portrayed some serious narcissistic traits. Not sure if this is interrelated. He ended up cheating and breaking up with me, go figure. 

Is this considered a relapse or did he never intend on remaining clean?",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5359891}"

As I begin to type words on the page- there’s a feeling I can only describe as surreal. My addiction to alcohol and coke, sex and love, has destroyed years of my life. Now, I get high on life. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to provide service to a group of men in recovery that I barely know- and it was blissful. Settlers of Catan is much more fun sober. 

There was authenticity, real connection, joy and hurt. Experiencing the spectrum human emotion sober ain’t so bad.

I haven’t had 100 days of sobriety since I started drinking at age 17. I am now 36. What hurts the most is that **I stopped growing in my addiction.** I’m so much smarter and stronger than I was ever capable of showing people when I was using and acting out daily. In my addiction the goalpost kept moving. The boundless narrative of, “once I get X then Y will happen” is a fallacy. It’s not true. Recovery is an inside job. And here’s what I am most thankful for today...

**An abundance of energy.** Monday thru Friday, I wake up at 4:45 am to the jazz of Miles Davis. I manage to fill my time with work projects, addiction work, family, exercise and self-care- for the entirety of the day. The frequency and length of my vibration is strong.

**I have a hard time placing hope in things unseen.** **That’s changing.** Now I notice Higher Power in the little things; a sip of coffee, a bite of home prepared breakfast, a walk to the gym. All activities that I took (still sometimes take) for granted. Previously used as a means to cure a hangover, are now seen as gifts of life. 

**Emotions. I feel them.** I cried during the movie Just Mercy. Stories of men wrongfully accused on death row should make me sad. It did. Spending time with loved ones should fill me up with love. It did. Yesterday afternoon. Being acutely aware of what feelings visit, then pass, is what life is about. I don’t need to escape them. 

**Stronger custody of my eyes.** Maybe some of you are familiar with the turn and look that happens when you pass someone you find attractive? Definitely a sign of powerlessness for me. Now, most of the time, I’m mostly too interested in my own needs to get distracted by women I don’t know.

**Recovery provided me with the gift of time**. Hours of sobriety in the day give me faith that all that needs to get done will happen in time. No rush. More ease. 

**Sober people in recovery are my tribe.** No friends in my life were interested in getting sober. And that’s pretty sad. I’ve been obsessed with this idea that I needed to find my tribe for some years now. The bar was always the place I looked first. Now, I know that the people I meet in the Rooms of AA and SLAA are the types of people that I need in my life. Flaws and all. You are my tribe. 

Thank you for sharing your experience, strength and hope. I will continue to be grateful.

Be blessed.",9,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.50335354}"

Homeless, addicted to fentanyl, I considered ending it all. Yet, the next morning, I woke up still. Broken, hopeless, with nowhere to go, I made the decision to check into detox. I did the final cap I had left, and began reaching out to friends I've made in my recovery fellowship.
   A friend helped me with an Uber to Del Rey, and I checked myself in to DAF. I walked through the intake door, not knowing if they even had a bed available. Lucky, they admitted me.
   Over the course of the next week, God has slowly resurrected me from death. Everyday I slowly began feeling better and better. I was informed yesterday that I would be leaving on Sunday. I met someone in detox willing to help me get into a halfway house.
   Today I was informed I would be released. He won't be released until tomorrow. But still, I had a sense of calmness over me. I didn't know where I would stay tonight. I hadn't had a dollar to my name. A backpack full of clothes, a cell phone I wasn't sure was still connected, And nowhere to stay. Yet, something telling me not to worry. I felt I would be taken care of.
   After changing out of my scrubs, and receiving the small amount of property I had, I powered up my phone. My stimulus was deposited. Sober, fully intent on working my program, I message my sponsor, informing him of the last few weeks. He already knew.
   As I lay on this hotel bed, I contemplate the few hours I've had since being release. Had an amazing dinner, a scoop of Ben and Jerry's, and a short walk on the beach to finish the night.
I am truly grateful to have my life back. I have alot of work to do yet, but I feel I'm on the right path. I have a God that provides for me, I'm grateful for the people in my life still, and I live for the ones I have lost along the way.

And still counting,"During the darkest parts of my addiction i couldn’t imagine going even 5 days sober. Now i’m here 5 months after making the decision to get clean wondering where it all went wrong in the first place. 

Recently i’ve been doing a lot of reflecting on the days i spent fucked up on drugs. There’s some parts of it i miss , during my addiction my life did a complete 180. For the first time in years i was doing nothing with my life. Not working, sleeping the days away, getting high, etc. I enjoyed that careless lifestyle where i lived in the moment and didn’t care about tomorrow. Although in the back of my mind i knew it couldn’t be this way forever. 

All of that changed 5 months ago when everything came full circle. After the week of treacherous withdrawals things started to come back together again. Started working everyday like i used to, and i started to get back in my old daily routine. 

That was until i started craving the high again. After putting it off so many times i eventually caved and relapsed. It was genuinely the worst time i’ve ever had and it showed me that i cannot return back to this drug ever again. I still feel that way to this day. 

Next month will mark the time that my binge started , Lasting 6 months from April-October. It was one hell of a ride that i don’t regret at all as it helped put me in the place i am today. 

I hope everyone is doing well and staying on the right path these days. Don’t let your demons control you, instead show them how strong you can be.

I've been struggling to maintain sobriety for a while now. I can go stretches here and there (longest one lately being 10 days) where I can stay sober but inevitably the depression and anxiety get the better of me and I run back to my comfortable blanket. My brain also tricks me into thinking I've got it handled after going a stretch sober. 

Here lately though, the drugs are really not helping with the depression. Even activities that I associate with using (like having several beers while cooking a meal) are not enjoyable anymore. So no matter what, whether I'm sober or using, I'm going to feel that depression at some point. It hits different for each but it doesn't matter. It's there and I'm going to have to find new ways for dealing with it.

So I'm gonna take another stab at going sober starting tomorrow. With this revelation I'm hoping I can make it longer than 10 days this time. No point to this post really, just feeling low and felt like ranting. I did want to say to anyone out there that might be struggling, keeping a journal and writing in that thing every single day no matter what can be a game changer. It helps to increase your own awareness and if consistently stated, can be a constant reminder of long term goals over short term pleasure.

Backstory: I first started calory counting to have stability with my food, this changed to me trying to get the most amount of food by volume for my calories. I realised I had a problem, after spending the entire evening on making food for watching a movie, which I did once a week. I also realized I was thinking about nothing but food

Current Problem:

I have now ""quit"" for one week, from what I would call a ""Volume Eating Addiction"": Spending way too much time and resources on getting the most amount of Food for the lowest calories (Goes hand in hand with binge eating addiction and food obsession)

When I was addicted I used to constantly look forward to the next time I could eat, like in 'mentally reviewing my day and the upcoming days, looking forward to the next meal'. I especially did this when I was bored

Now I try to spend time on other things but I often review my day mentally and, lacking the enjoyment of food, cant find anything else to look forward to as much. Then I get sad about my day and forseeable future looking boring

So I had 2 relapses and finally got to 63 days it felt so awesome. I felt great. Then one day, I get home and eventually my parents leave so it's just me and my sister. Me and my sister go through my parent's room to look for court documents and such because my dad always says if I knew what my mom said that we would be enlightened that he's a good person or some shit. Anyways, there was this emergency hearing 3-4 months ago over my mom leaving pills out and me relapsing. They weren't actually left out I had gotten through some locks and took them. This hearing was called by my dad due to my relapses. He always talks about how irresponsible this is. Anyways, there was a court order that everything had to be locked up. He decided not to follow it and being an addict is not good. I found percoets and gabapentin. Immediately I wanted to take them. But, I didn't I went to a meeting and talked about exactly what happened. Everyone congratulated me and told me I was doing an awesome job. 

Upon going back home I cannot stop thinking about them. It's on my mind constantly and it just won't go away. They are also 50 feet away from me at this time. I was trying so hard but had just succumbed to them. I snorted them in my bathroom. My dad then found out from my mom and proceeded to literally destroy my bathroom door. Like I mean it was locked and he punched it down and broke it. He then proceeds to back me up into a corner and get very very close and cussing me out and started touching me and trying to take my phone. He has hit me in the past and has made death threats against my mom so I had no fucking clue what he was going to do. 

I feel awful about my relapse. I had so much time. Everyone was so proud of me. I feel worthless and like it's gonna take forever to get it back. I lost 63 days. That's my record and meant so much to me. Now I have court on Monday and am at risk for probation among other shit. I'm really worried.

He has abused every substance he’s ever been prescribed...first ambien, then pain meds & now alcohol. He’s been drinking so irresponsibly lately that I’ve been considering separation. He’s not only drinking in massive excess (more than a fifth a day), but doing it during the work day (while working from home), starting early in the morning, continuing the behavior despite numerous heart to hearts, arguments & everything in between. 

Just today, I caught him drinking during work (again). An argument ensued & I told him (& this wasn’t the first time) that I think he has a problem (ie he’s an addict) & needs professional help (ie rehab). Now I’m not a medical professional so I don’t know if that’s actually his diagnosis, but what was interesting today is that he actually admitted that he’s an addict (after denying it for literally our entire 9 year relationship). 

On top of his addictive behaviors, I’ve also suspected he’s a narcissist. What I’m trying to understand is if this change of tune could be him actually coming to terms with being an addict or if this could be a narcissistic behavior. It’s almost as if he’s OK with being an addict...like it’s a badge of honor or a testament to what he’s gone through in life.

This is not about myself but, rather about a friend. I am concerned because I am not sure if she is really using her fentanyl genuinely and legitimitely, for pain relief (she has Alers Danlos Syndrome) or if she is abusing the drug... or both? How can I tell the difference as an out-sider? Maybe I can not be 100% but I want to have your in-put and know of signs to look for..

She is very out spoken about how addiction and dependence is not the same, and dependence naturally happens even if a person is legitimitely using the drug for relief and even if they are not addictive, however, I would like your input.

The friend is bed bound most of the time, and , says she is constantly in pain, she is super skinney and barley has an appetite, she claims to be unable to do physical work such as taking out trash (but other times when she feels better she can do certain things like cleaning but she says that takes a toll and is than bed ridden again for a day or two after) and even getting around to places and driving at times.. Other signs include getting hot / sweating easily and once in a while vomiting. Also I am not as sure about this but I think there has been some paranoia before too.

On the other hand she says she has very severe Alers Danlos and often dislocates bones and has hyper mobility. For me as a out-sider it is hard to know what is do to Alers Danlos and what is do to the drug and if this is a case of addiction or just someone who really needs the pain relief...

We've never had problems sharing our thoughts and feelings. They have always been a smoker, both weed and cigarettes, and an occasional recreational drug user. A few years ago I moved to another state so we are not physically in each others lives except for visits, but we text/call multiple times every single day. Over the past several years they have gradually been circling downward: They are smoking three packs of cigarettes a day. They got prescribed xanax and adderal and lately even a kind of narcotic(not sure what). They have always taken medication to manage bipolar disorder and anxiety, etc, but mostly types that had very little possibility for abuse. Way back when we met they told me that they knew they had a problem with adderal and tried not to use it. They also had chronic kidney stones and had taken opioids occasionally in the past, but never developed an issue with them.   
Over the past year or so they have been getting worse. They always run out of their meds before they are supposed to, when I have brought it up they've told me it's because they share it with their partner. They have done the ""I'm going on vacation can I pick it up early?"" thing with their doctors multiple times. They almost exclusively use them(adderal at least) by crushing them and snorting them. When I have brought this up they rationalize that it's just another way of taking them and that there is nothing wrong with it. It has gotten worse and worse and in the past several months they have even used meth. They had a group of friends for years that they were very close with and when the group found out they cut ties with them. I always knew that I was only getting half the story and from what I could gather the group of friends ""attacked"" them by being concerned about them and trying to get them help. But I tried to just be understanding and sympathetic since I didn't know the whole story.   
A little while later and they are still spiraling down and have used meth more than once. They say they are using it safely, but like, it's meth. They visited weeks ago and their nose was constantly running and had blue powder around it from snorting. They had a horrible smokers cough which had been getting gradually worse over the years. Their day was a cycle of literally musing out loud whether they wanted uppers or downers, railing drugs, then balancing out with the other. And then getting high as shit on narcotics(They're own words as they lie half passed out on my couch).  
After their visit they asked me if I was going to come visit for their birthday, I said I couldn't and they pushed me for why. So I sent them a long message explaining that I couldn't watch them kill themselves and that I thought their drug use had become very destructive and that I couldn't deal with it in person. I tried to only use supportive language and did my best not to make it sound like an attack and I followed it up with several other supportive messages that I would always be there for them and would help any way I could and would always be rooting for them.  


And with that message they immediately turned on me. Called me an ignorant bitch that needed to mind her own business, that I had no idea what I was talking about, that their drugs were prescribed and I needed to knock it off with the ""holier than thou bullshit"". They finished it with several messages telling me to never contact them again. After ten years of being integral parts of one another lives I have been excommunicated, exactly like what happened with their other group of friends. My question, to anyone that has read this far, is what do I do? I don't want them to just drift away and die. I live too far away to be a part of their life in person. Right now I know with certainty that they are cutting me off and rewriting the narrative in their heads to vilify me and turn me into a demon. But I still love them and want to help no matter what. I haven't responded to any of the hurtful things they have said with anything but support and affirmations that I care and am on their side. What can I do? What should I do?

I've been following the community for a few   weeks already and it has been very helpful for me reading the posts of   people sharing the exact same feelings I had many times. Thank you to   the community moderators for creating a space in which we can share our   problem and get support.

I  started  gambling 15 years ago, and probably I will be a gambling addict  for the  rest of my life, I am one of those who think that this kind of   disorders are never cured, just controlled, and hell is tough to do  so,  but certainly not impossible.

I   would not be able to say how much money I squandered on gambling  during  my remarkable gambling career, and I say remarkable because if I  compare  the amounts that I lost during my first YEAR of gambling (a  few  hundred) to the amounts that I lost in the last MONTHS of my  addiction  (a few hundreds of thousands), it is really a remarkable  progression.  What started with a $5 free bet and as a weekend  entertainment, ended in  gamling thousands of dollars per hand on a  Blackjack table in an online  casino.

Through  the years, losing  more and more never stopped me, all the opposite, I  increased stakes,  borrowed more money... all to keep the fantasy of  recovering all my  losses one day. That will never happen.

Gambling   has an exponential losing curve; the more you lose, the more you try  to  bet in the next bet to recover. Sometimes you are lucky and get back   your money, but for some reason, after increasing your stakes, you  never  go back to previous stakes. If you do, probably because of  Murphy’s  law, you win your next bet, so your brain, for whatever  reason, thinks  that you should have kept the stakes high, and you would  have won more  money. In most cases, you do so next time, increasing  the stakes again,  but luck does not last forever, and you end up in a  spiral of trying to  recover higher amounts each time.

After   hitting rock bottom, finding myself with over US$ 400k of debt, and    being on the verge of losing my home, my family, and my own company, I   decided to play my last hand on 26th December 2020. Not at the casino.   That hand was against me, against my gambling addiction, against my own   devil. I took a set of cards that I have at home, shuffled them, and   dealt. Two face cards for me that added eighteen, one face card – a   Queen of hearts - and one hidden card for the devil. No money was   involved: “If I win, I seek help, treatment and start recovery.” That   was the promise. The stake was my own life.

I   am not sure what I could have done at that point. I had no desire to   live at all. I was destroyed. Sadly, gambling-related suicides represent   a significant number globally, and that number is increasing every   year.

Fortunately, I won that   hand. The devil busted against my eighteen. That day I promised myself   never to play again. I was born again on 26th December 2020, and I hope   to celebrate my gambling-free birthday for many years to come.

After   coming clean with my family to seek support, I started the recovery   process expecting to finally leave behind the gambling world, the bad   experiences, and all the lies and excuses that I have used to cheat my   loved ones to continue with my addiction. I have been away from gambling   for a couple of months only, that is absolutely nothing, and all this   process just has started and has a very long way ahead, but I am a   complete different person already. First weeks were really tough, and I   still have cravings many days, mostly on weekends. I tried to find new   hobbies and I even published a short story on the Kindle Store (the  book  is called ""Splitting Tens"", I do not want to post any link here to   avoid people thinking that I am just posting to promote the book, and  if  the moderators consider that I should not even mention it, please  let  me know and I remove the name). I mention it because on the  toughest  days, when I was not able to get out of bed, writting  everything out  helped me a lot.

I  consider myself  a privileged person. After what I did, I still have my  family around  supporting me (which seems quite unbelievable), and that  support is what  is giving me the strength to fight a way out of my  situation and  realize that it is possible to find a way to start a new  life and left  behind all the problems I caused to myself and those who  love me.

Maybe  not all gamblers  are gambling addicts, but if you do gamble, and at  some point in your  life, you start seeing that it controls your life,  accumulating losses  day after day, and increasing your stakes, that you  only think about  recovering the losses… Please, stop and seek help. You  will be on time  to solve the situation, no matter how bad it is (I can  tell you mine is  very bad). I wish I realized that earlier and did not  put myself in  the position I am in. I hope that my story helps people  who are in the  early stage of the disease to stop and get treatment  because it will  never get better through the path of gambling.

To me it has alot to do with shame. When I suffer I've  always been through rough periods with alot of drugs, going way below the human bar of acceptable and ""normal"" behaviour. So when the drugs leave my system, it's always replaced with high amounts of shame, making me crawl down the tiniest holes to hide away on my own. 

I need to let go of that cripling shame and learn to let people actually know what I'm going through. Talk honestly about the way I suffer, talk about all the shit I've just done or am about to do.

No matter what I will always suffer, existence equals pain, no way around that, but I seem to have found out just recently, that it's my approach to the suffering that somehow causes me the greatest pain. If I lie and hide away, my pain multiplides tenfolds, but if I take the honest approach (which is not easy), letting people in, it somehow just gets easier. What a f***ing revelation, it only took like 25+ years to realize that.

Well it's a work in progress, changing that many years of bad behaviour doesn't happen overnight, but I now know, that my approach to it all, makes a huge difference.

I was going to joke around saying “addiction” and what not but after I started reading some of the posts on this sub holy shit, stay fucking strong!!

My actual addiction though,

On Dec 27,2020 I threw my electronic single use e-cig at the ground, recorded it and told myself I wont touch nicotine for all of 2021 ever since that day.. Well, here we are 2 months and 11 days into the new year and I have stayed true to my goal. It’s been hard, I’ve caught myself many times, saying ” just one”, or “its social smoking” or “I should reward myself because I havent smoked in 2 months” but from how I see it this is just a desperate attempt of my brain trying to trick me into poisoning myself, again.  I started substituting the urge to smoke nicotine with marijuana (weed) . I’d go and smoke a joint, sometimes I’d smoke 2, 3, 4 in a day because it distracted me from the actual urge to smoke a cigarette or those super convenient single use nicotine electronics smh! 

Now I’ve started to take a step back from weed. It’s too nice, it makes me so calm, it makes me feel good mentally, motivated and so many other things I don’t get when I’m sober. Sounds great right? Wrong, this is exactly why it has become a problem. I used to say its harmless and make excuses for it, but now I’m starting to really understand that living a sober life is the hardest thing for me to do! I truly wish to feel “high off life” as people say and the only way to really feel that way is stop doing things that sugarcoat life for me, like weed does. I’m still at odds with myself about weed, sometimes it does more good than harm and thats why I’m having such a hard time completely cutting it out. 

I’m going to take a month long tolerance break, I’m only on day 2 of not smoking weed but I’m adamant about withholding for a month. I will give an update in a month, since I’m posting this on here, I pinky promise every single one of you that I wont be touching neither Weed or Nicotine until that post.

During the American Revolution, the United States fought against tyranny, oppression, and bondage. Like the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon, we had our fair share of disadvantages. Things did not look good and a plague of doubt and hopelessness swept the nation. This was called “The Crisis” as Americans started to realize, one by one, that there was little chance at winning this war. A few men stayed to fight but many men gave up and returned home – these men were called “sunshine patriots,” meaning they were loyal to their country only while it was winning or while the tides had been turned in its favor.

The term was coined by Thomas Paine in a written address during this widespread depression crisis, “THESE are the times that try men’s souls,” he wrote. Times of sadness and despair, times of misery and suffering.

In times of prosperity, it seems there is God all around us. He’s in our bounty, in the beauty, in our wealth. So, with him so prominent, feeling so blessed, it’s easy to believe. It is in times of challenge and hardship, of loss and bad-luck that our faith is tested, that *we* are tested. The entire point behind faith is that *you don’t know for sure, but you believe.* When times get rough, when it seems there is *no evidence* of God – how could he allow such suffering? – these are the times that God is asking you, “Do you believe in me, even if I don’t show you that I’m here?”

And faith is hard work. Faith in God, or faith in yourself – it doesn’t \*poof\* appear out of nowhere as if sprouting from the tip of your nose. Faith takes effort, it takes investment, it takes constantly reminding yourself of your cause and your reasons and your future. In times of wealth, fortune, and happiness, it is easy to love and to believe in God; when you are succeeding, it is easy to believe in yourself, just like the sunshine patriots were easily patriots when their country was in the lead. However, just like them, we often find that we may not have much faith in times of challenge.

“What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly,” wrote Paine. We tend to give things the value that we pay for them, and things that cost too little effort we tend to give less importance. The more profound our struggle, the more profound our victory. “Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.”

“By perseverance and fortitude we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and submission, the sad choice of a variety of evils – a ravaged country – a depopulated city – habitations without safety, and slavery without hope – our homes turned into barracks and bawdy-houses for Hessians, and a future race to provide for, whose fathers we shall doubt of. Look on this picture and weep over it! and if there yet remains one thoughtless wretch who believes it not, let him suffer it unlamented.”

Man’s faith in his country is tested when it seems that his country might lose the war, but it is in these times that his country needs for him to believe in her the most, needs for him to believe in her motivations and morals and principles, to believe in her people and in the strength of independence and freedom, to believe in right and wrong, that Truth will defeat Lie and Good will defeat Evil and Light will defeat Darkness. Because remember: the few brave men that *did* stay and fight, those who *did* believe – just like the Athenians, they ended up winning.

What was it about them that made them stay, against all logic and such a bad prognosis? Their faith. And what did it take to keep their faith, even to the bloody, savage end? Courage.It takes *courage* to act on and to keep faith.

Courage is bravery, especially in the face of fear or pain, it’s the will and perseverance to do what you know is right; the horse that leads you proudly into battle – your own version of spears and shields wielded in defense of liberty, family, and your tomorrow.

For some of us, when we think of courage we think of saving the girl or sticking up to the bully. Sometimes, courage is being honest or admitting a mistake. Sometimes, it’s defending and protecting something that we love. We know courage when we see it, when we feel it, and sometimes even more importantly, we know when courage is lacking. Courage is not drug- or high-induced, it cannot be acted or faked and it cannot be tricked. Courage can’t be manufactured, it comes not from the outside but from our very own jelly-filled centers.

Courage can be fostered, however, it can be cultivated, it can grow inside of  us little by little as we use it in practice. When we believe in something, we create a courage inside of us to defend that belief. When we love something, we find within ourselves the courage to protect and care for it. When we want something, we muster the courage to do what it takes to get up and get it. Courage will always defeat a lack of courage. Courage will always defeat narcissism, cowardice, and apathy, for courage is selfless, it is brave, a passionate illumination of the dark and the empty. Even when we feel weak, if we are courageous we will be powerful.

Facing your own addiction means a lot of things. It means facing the fact that you have a problem, which means facing the fact that you’re out of your own control. It means facing all of the mistakes you’ve made including people you’ve hurt, things you’ve destroyed, and relationships that have been suffering. It means making a decision to put effort toward changes, some of which will be very hard to implement. It means having to apologize for some things, having to make up for some things, and having to re-earn the trust of those closest to us. It means saying goodbye to a life we knew well and once may even have loved. Ultimately, it means facing a future of uncertain anxieties and hard work – and doing this takes *courage*. It takes *courage* to face our pasts and our addictions and it takes *courage* to face our futures and our recoveries – and a recovering addict must *simultaneously face both*.

 

## “You will come to learn that what appears to be a sacrifice todaywill prove to be the greatest investment you’ll ever make.” – Gordon B. Hinkley

&#x200B;

Pain is your body’s way of directing your focus onto a problem so that the problem can be resolved as quickly, efficiently, and effectively as possible. Pain serves to protect us, as does fear, letting us know that something is wrong and alerting us to a possible threat. When you lay your hand on a hot stove burner, it takes but a split second for you to jerk your hand away – and that’s because pain is doing its job. If the pain hadn’t told you that you were cooking yourself, you’d have done a lot more damage than just blister the skin.

The same is true for emotional or mental pain. If you are hurting then something is wrong. Before you can get help, you have to recognize that you need help – and before you can recognize that you need help, you have to recognize that there’s a problem. Though it may seem logical, this isn’t always obvious. Sometimes it’s harder for us to see that there’s something wrong with the way we’re feeling, acting and behaving because that would mean admitting some mistakes, and it’s much easier for us to reason those away than it is to confront them. Allowing yourself to consider that you’ve got a problem is a major milestone in your addiction and recovery process.

Your next big milestone will be admitting that you need help, admitting that you need an outside perspective, support, advice, or even just a friend to talk to. Addiction has kept you trapped at the rancid bottom of an old well and you’ve been trying to climb the walls, clawing at them, fingernails broken and bloody – but it’s too dark to see down here, there’s nothing to hold on to, the walls are slippery smooth, the climb is too high, you know you’re fated here to rot – so if someone cast down a rope, would you not take it?

Some people refuse the rope, claiming they don’t need any help, they aren’t struggling, they can do this all on their own and they will be fine. Some people refuse the rope because they’re afraid it might make them appear weak and incapable. Some people refuse the rope because they know, deep down, they don’t deserve the generosity. But those who *do* take the rope are the ones who are back in the sunlight. Asking for help takes a lot of guts. Accepting help takes a lot of guts. But successful people do whatever they must in order to win, and if asking for help is what it’s going to take then you’d better be prepared to suck it up and do so. After you’ve taken that initial step and begun your healing process, then you’re already on your way, things have already started to improve, and some of the hardest parts about all of this are behind you.

I hear people sometimes say, ""I'm not afraid of anything."" And they think their (alleged) lack of fear is what makes them courageous. They think by having no worries or anxieties or apprehensions that they are the ones who are strong, who are independent and powerful. But if you fear nothing, how can you ever be brave? No, bravery does not come from a lack of fear, bravery comes in the face of fear. Those who are fearful - fearful of recovery, of hard work, of pain, of uncertainty - those who are afraid are those who've the opportunity to stand up to their fear, the opportunity to be truly brave, truly courageous, truly righteous.

Having to face up to your flaws and mistakes and accepting that it’s time for a change is hard – it takes strength, it takes *courage.* If you are fearful, if you are scared, if you are anxious - that's good. That just means you've been given the opportunity to stand up to those fetid voices in your head, to prove to yourself and to the world that your fear, your pain is not your *weakness*, it is your valiant battle *against* fear and pain, it's every forward step *despite* pain, *despite* fear, *despite* anxiety, it's the fight for your future no matter the darkness you're in - your weaknesses are testing you, and that - along with such a bright, sober future in mind - is making you *strong*.

## “Self-control is the chief element of self-respect,and self-respect is the chief element of courage.” -Thucydides

&#x200B;

Courage can come from a belief in yourself, a confidence in your own capabilities that allows for that belief. Courage is in knowing your own boundaries and limitations – and your ability in extending them. Courage is a *self-respect*, built by experience and opposition, by defiance and provocation, by the trials and lessons of addiction.

*Self-respect* is *earned.* And it is earned the same way that respect for other people or other things is earned – through experiences that prove *honesty*, exemplify *capabilities*, and build *trust*. A big part of recovery is rebuilding relationships, and that includes our relationships with ourselves. Right now, you don’t trust yourself to do the things you say you will do, though you may fully *intend* to follow through. You have seen yourself break too many promises to other people, you have heard yourself lie too many times to other people, you have witnessed your own greed and gluttony and you haven’t seen much self-control lately. You know you are flighty, you know you are unreliable, you know you are victim to your emotions and that makes you fickle and erratic. No, if anyone is to distrust you and your sincerity right now, it’s yourself.

Just like you have to prove yourself to your friends and family, you will have to prove yourself to you, too. As you navigate your recovery, you will have opportunities to show yourself that you mean what you say, you are trustworthy, what you’re capable of, that you’re resolute and reliable, that there’s no one you can count on more, that you will never have to depend on anyone or anything else again. After a while, and with enough effort, trust can be re-built, and you will start to believe in your own words again. And after a while, that trust becomes solid, and with that solidified trust comes a power, a strength, a supportive inner coordination and a confidence. This confidence can bleed outward, onto every other aspect of our lives, helping to motivate and inspire us to do what we feel we need to do, to be courageous and fight for the things that we know are right – *like our recovery.*

It's like I only use them when I feel like I have to do things that ""don't align with my truth"" so to speak. 

My biggest trigger is money / career choices. Looking for office jobs makes me wanna get high. Then, for while I was completely sober, working out a lot and feeling strong - I got a model job out of nowhere. Didn't even apply for it. I had no wish to use drugs at the time because the job was somehing I was passionate about.

Now I've had two office work job offers and what have I done? I got so high the night before I didn't make it to the job interview. I thought about those jobs a lot, tried to convince myself I could like them. But honestly? I don't like them. I'm not excited about them.

It's just that everybody says how hard it is to get jobs and money is so important - yes, money is important. But if I do a job that makes me unhappy, guess where the money goes? To drugs.

Whenever I've had a ""meh"" feeling about a job, it turned out to be not right for me. I'm in such an inner struggle. It's hard to decline offers but at the same time I believe - If it don't feel right, it ain't right. Better things come along, I just have to stop dwelling on whether I made the right decision or not. 

I'm looking for validation honestly. It's not that I'm afraid of the challenges of the office jobs - it's just: The only reason I would do them is for the money which isn't even that much. I don't see myself being inspired or growing in those environments.

Why don't I do model jobs or something like that? Actually that was just a conincidence, I'm not at an agency or something. I'm looking for jobs as a working student. 

If I had really wanted to, I could have made to those job interviews. It's like I was hoping they reject me so I don't have to reject them. I'm missing guidance. People so easily say ""just do the job for the money"" but it's more than that - it's your lifetime and your energy. You can always quit but would you have the guts to quit on the spot or after a month?

I've decided to go to rehab eventually, and that was the best decision I've made in my life! Mentally I wanted to beat the addiction, and that helped a lot. I've been gone for two weeks, and the first few days was the hardest. 

They put me on 2mg suboxone first, but I felt really bad and they gave me another 2mg. After that I still felt bad. I couldn't sleep there for 3 days. Literally in 3 days I only slept 5 hours, and they offered me more suboxone so that I could atleast have some sleep. I refused that, and other medicines because I wanted to do it on my own powers, and that really paid off! In the end I only needed to stay for 2 weeks, and that was surprising. I asked if I could stay longer,  but that wasn't necessary because I've done so well. 

Now I'm 10 weeks back, and 70 days sober! Sometimes the days are difficult, because in the end I'm still an addict, but mentally you need to be strong enough. What helps is that I live from day to day, and that's keeping me SANE. Always having something to do everyday, and stay away from your house helps alot. 

For everyone who wants to seek help, I'd say do it! What are a few weeks or a few months compared to 20-30-40 years you're gonna live, with your loved ones. There are a lot of rehab centers, and explore more than one. Go to the one you feel the most comfortable with, and take that deep dive, and fight your addiction because the feeling of being sober after all those years is refreshing!

If you've any questions don't hesitate to comment or send me a DM. I'll try to respond to everyone one of you!


______________________________________________

Hi guys first of all thanks everyone for willing to help me. I'll keep it short. I've been an addict for almost 4 years now, and decided last year to get help.

Since my addiction I got RLS(Restless legs syndrome), and I only have that when I haven't been using for 2 days. Also the after affects are so difficult to deal with. The past 2 years I've been snorting 1gr a day, and that's 10gr a week. Now the couple few month's I've been using only 1gr max a week. And I achieved this all by myself, and not without any help. Mentally I'm strong and I want to quit, but the after effects, the RLS, etc is so heavy..  wish I could inject something and bam I'm not an addict anymore.

The institution where I go weekly wants me to get on subuxone, their reasoning was that its easier to get off from it, and it doesn't affect my COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Chronische Obstructieve Long disease) it has 5 stages that goes from 0 till 5. 

I've taken methadone before, and it really helped me while I used it, and felt really comfortable with it. It's really expensive tho, but having a stuffed nose for 4 years also really sucks.  I've never inject heroin and never will. I once smoked it, but the next day I needed to use my asthma cause I couldn't breath. I rather have methadone But the institution I've joined said that methadone can also be very addictive, and that's why they wanted me on subuxone. 

So my question is does subuxone helps me sleep, and negate the RLS, and is it really better than methadone?

  I have been using meth for going on 10 yrs now, daily probably the last 5yrs. I am married and have a 6yr old son. I have a great job and love my family. I’m not your “typical” tweeker. I don’t run with other users, I work hard and come home to my family every night. I use in between all this though. Really at this point I use just to keep going I think, and well I’m an addict is another reason. I have used drugs since I was 14 but mostly drinking and eating acid and shrooms (the good bad drugs). Had a romance with crack for a bit but now Im stuck in the shit with meth. In patient treatment is not an option right now and outpatient is hit and miss for me. I have experienced both in my previous days before these last ten 
years. I know that if I don’t fix this it will eventually catch up to me. I am terrified at the possibility of hurting my family by letting them down if I end up in jail or bankrupt us or any of the other severe consequences of this addiction. My wife knows about it but kind of stays out of it. When it comes to the surface,usually after something drastic happens, I tell her I will quit and then of course that never works out. By then though enough time has passed that if I tell her Im trying to find help or need to find help, she gets pissed because I have been doing it since the last time I said I would quit. She doesn’t know that I use daily. I have stayed up until at least 2am every night for the past 5-7yrs and go to work at 8am every day, That can’t be healthy. Im hoping to connect with anyone who has had success beating this on their own. Thank you for reading all this. Hope it wasn’t too much ramble.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6407232}"

I’ve tried to get sober many times with to no avail, I’ve tried religion, exercise, therapy, meetings and whatever else. But the truth is that I just don’t care, or maybe I care way to much. I’m not to sure, I have a big heart with a small mind. That’s how I feel.....small compared to everyone else and how the think and act, I think and believe I am not smart, but then again I know I am. But I just can’t understand what it is to be ok with not being ok.

I will hold them and tell them I love them and be there for them and build them up and tell them it’s okay to hurt, it’s ok that you have used and whatever, being an addict means unfortunately in this day and age even though it’s becoming widely accepted, we’re still in a different caste and I feel second rate. I just would love to be happy with who I am and not critical of myself and my thoughts. I use to because I’m wound up to tight and I worry all the time and the drugs always make me not worry and calm me down, especially the opiates, heroin, and benzo’s and whatever......it’s like I need to be and feel sedated all the time just to function through time. I wanna be the best version of myself that I can be...without drugs. I’m so tired and very exhausted from all the years of use.....I don’t want to be an addict but I am, and although I do accept it and kind of wear it as a badge I despise myself for it, but I have learned so much from it. I wish I could just really understand why I use and why I always keep going back out, I am very lucky, I have had success in my life even as an addict and a third time felon with a ovi, I still find a way to preserver and idk, I have a good job, good kids, a girlfriend....I’m currently going through a divorce but it’s weird cuz my wife and I still love each other very much but the relationship is toxic and broken.....I’m not sure how to go about that.

2021-03-09 14:05:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m1dlyy/hello_reddit_i_need_advice_on_how_to_proceed_with/,Hello Reddit I need advice on how to proceed with me over stepping boundaries in regards to concerns with my sisters drug abuse. [Kinda long a bit but please help and read fully],"Please try to remain none subjective when responding and realize that what was done is done and ranting at me for my decisions will not provide advice I am looking for. 

A few months ago I overstepped my sister's boundaries and called her psychiatrist with concerns regarding the prescribing of benzodiazepines to her.

First I would like to state that I was aware I was overstepping boundaries when I made the decision to call her psychiatrist but I Weighed the negatives versus the positives of overstepping boundaries and I came to the conclusion that The benefits outweighed the negatives and that I would be okay with accepting the consequences of my actions.


The reason I called my sister psychiatrist was because she admitted to me that she was going to suggest her doctor prescribe her a benzodiazepine to treat her anxiety. 

Benzodiazepines have high potential for abuse and addiction. 

I was concerned with her receiving a prescription because my sister has exhibited drug abuse and addiction throughout most of her life. 

Since I have lived with her she has shown that she will do anything to get high especially when she does not have any pot. 

She has stolen my mother's benzodiazepines in the past as well as she admitted to me that she attempted to steal mine but was unsuccessful. 

She once abused a over-the-counter sleep aid in an attempt to get high. 

She already had a problem with abusing her ADHD medication.

She is also irresponsible regarding medication in that a few weeks ago she had left out a medication on her bed and to which one of her children had gotten access to and did something with as we found the bottle empty concerned that she may have ingested the substance we called poison control who assured us that even if the child did consume the contents that it was not life-threatening.

So after that call I made my sister take all of her medication and put it in the cabinet in the bathroom so it was out of reach of the children. 

then my sister has obtained new medication and once again I had noticed that she left it on the bed in her room instead of putting it in the cabinet. 
Once again this shows irresponsibility. 

My parents are also enabling her self-destructive behavior regarding medication and drug abuse in that they feel that it is not a problem that she smokes pot because they state that it is beneficial Because it allows her to eat and relieves anxiety. 

furthermore speaking with my mother expressing my concerns to my mother she has also been pushing for her to receive benzodiazepines to manage her anxiety despite the obvious addictive behavior and addictive personality. 

However in a note of relief my mother stated that she would be locking up her medication and distributed accordingly.
But to add to that my mother will be moving out in a few months as who will manage her administration of her medication to ensure her safety when she lives on her own?

Also since I have lived here my sister has been very underweight and malnourished to the point that I had bought her protein shakes with vitamins and proteins to help her ensure that her body is getting the nourishment it needs. Thus pot is proving to be ineffective in treating her eating issues. 

 My sister also claims that pot helps with her anxiety since I lived here She has expressed anxiety even when she smokes. Thus I feel pot is ineffective in treating her anxiety. 

I called my sister's psychiatrist and left an anonymous message explaining all of these things and that I felt prescribing a benzodiazepine was unwise because of everything I explained and also according to the DSM-5 and the regulations set by the FDA benzodiazepines are only to be prescribed in those diagnosed with anxiety disorder or panic disorder. 

Well I feel that my sister does have anxiety I do not believe that an anxiety **disorder** is accurate because the DSM-5 states that one of the qualifiers for an anxiety disorder is that the patient must suffer from chronic anxiety 
**not caused by outside influences** since I lived here I have noticed that all of my sisters anxiety is caused by outside influences and her actions. Which would not qualify for her for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Even furthermore contradicting the FDA's guidelines he started her off on 1 mg of Ativan instead of 0.5. this doctor appears to be highly irresponsible and his decisions and assessments. I have also never seen her experience a single full blown panic attack in 4 months I have recently lived here. And I know the symptoms very intimately as I suffer from extreme anxiety disorders myself.

Therefore prescribing benzodiazepines would not be following the recommended guidelines. 

furthermore I believe that her psychiatrist had not tried all other alternatives to treating her anxiety disorders and is rather jumping to something with potential for abuse which is also against the FDA's guidelines and prescribing benzodiazepines. This is irresponsible of him.

Despite me warning her psychiatrist All these things he proceeded to prescribe her her a benzodiazepine anyway. 

The reason I did all of this is because I fear for my sister's safety as well as her children and that addiction is very highly likely to occur with her. I decided that my intervention was necessary despite the consequences I would face. 

My sisters psychiatrist has expressed that he received my phone call and have made her aware of it this is going to cause major issues with me and my parents. 

I am contemplating reporting my sister's psychiatrist to the board of health or whatever organization is appropriate.

I fear the argument that will ensue when this topic is inevitably discussed with my parents. 

I feel that even if I bring up everything I wrote here that my parents will be dismissive of the facts and fight me at every turn. I believe that they will cling to the fact that I overstep boundaries without acknowledging the reason why as well as the facts that I will point out. 

I spoke to my therapist about this and she suggests that I write all of this down so that's when we have to talk I can have the information written down to express easily and that is also part of the reason of this post. So I would like to ask all of you to please give me any additional advice that you may have. 

Also my sister's doctor diagnosed her with an unspecified mood disorder, and prescribed a heavy antipsychotic without knowing if it's even appropriate because he has not determined what mood disorder she has so he cannot calculate if the risk outweigh the benifits in prescribing an antipsychotic. That is very poor judgment and action on his part and once again he is not following the FDA guidelines. And I know my sister well enough to feel **strongly** that she does not have a mood disorder. She has never experienced hallucinations such as present in schizophrenia disorder and bipolar I disorder, she has also never experienced hypomania, such as present in bipolar II disorder and borderline personality disorder. she has never experienced a switch in personality such as present in DID. She has never experienced derealization, or paranoia present in almost all mood disorders. And more. 
At least she has never expressed these with me or her and I know this because I prodded her extensively on these things to gain a better understanding of her. 
Also I live with her.
But I do believe she has a much lower than average IQ. Many others agree with that. But that is not an appropriate reason to prescribe powerful antipsychotic drugs. 

Lastly I know that many of you will be very against my decision to overstep boundaries by calling my sisters psychiatrist but I would like you retain the reasons why I made the decision I did, as well as what was done was done and that I am looking for information on how to proceed.

(I hope it’s not degrading/insulting to those of you who’ve suffered from long term issues that I’m using the term ‘addiction’ - but I think that’s what it is?)

I don’t really have the money for therapy or such like at the moment, so does anyone have any advice or help that they’ve received, to help with those times when you start to get caught up in an addiction?

I say addictive personality because over the years I’ve fallen into various vices, but only for relatively short periods of time. When I had my first full time job at 18, the majority of my earnings went into gambling for months, since then I’ve avoided it until quite recently when I’ve felt the grip of it again. Another situation was a couple of years back, which started when I was in a rough patch of a relationship, but I ended up abusing ketamine almost daily - for months. This past month I got my hands on some speed - telling myself it would help my productivity - but again it’s got to the point where I’m using it every day, and I can’t seem to drag myself out of the hole. 

I’m not sure if this is even a cry out for advice, or perhaps just me trying to open up to anyone, but I do think any advice would be accepted graciously.

(Funnily enough I’ve never really had a problem with abusing alcohol, I think partly because my dad was an alcoholic so a part of my subconscious is sensible enough to stay away, and partly because my depression and anxiety gets massively worsened when I’m hungover)

Nothing unusual as this is the nature of addiction. I was partying with Mole in December and I've always been totally infatuated with him. Sweetest fucking guy I know. We hung out a lot over the summer, sober together as well. Beautiful summer I will cherish forever.

Cut to me losing my shit drinking every day unable to function. Go to rehab. Find out Mole is in a coma. Lots of hope he would come out of it. Days pass with no progress and I come home clean, to find out a week later Mole had passed away..

I still haven't processed his death and writing it out is helping.. but I still find myself waiting for him to show up randomly. I can't believe he's gone. I have never lost a close friend before and the fact that I was enamored by him makes it that much harder..

2021-03-08 11:37:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m0jnyq/10_years_clean/,10 Years Clean,"10 years ago this month I entered rehab for a debilitating Adderall and Ambien addiction. I remember sitting in my mothers car as we drove and asked...""How did I get here? How did I go from the dude that never drank at parties and hadn't done a hard drug since my early 20s to the guy that lost everything and is headed to rehab?"" I was prescribed both drugs, used them as they were supposed to be used...then, I remember the exact day I doubled my dose of Adderall...it was the end of life as I knew it. 

Over the next 3 years I would lose my job, fail at my own company, lose my home, move into my sisters garage, then to a weekly hotel, then to my car...then back to the hotel. I alienated everyone in my life...would go weeks without talking. Near the end, I was closed up in a closet for 2 days, without eating or using the bathroom, only drinking a little bit of water and doing Adderall. I was out of Ambien and couldn't sleep. I was dying and I knew it...and accepted it.

My sister called me and asked how I was...it was the first time I didn't lie about my situation...I told her I needed help. Mom showed up the next morning to take me to Rehab. Rock Bottom was a terrible place to be. Over the next two years I would relapse for a week here and a week there...then, I had a massive heart attack. The doctor told me I was no longer an Adderall addict...I was like, Really? He was like, Yep. See, if you do Adderall now it will kill you...so, no longer an addict. Point made.

I was surrounded by great and forgiving friends. I dug into my faith and went through the 12 steps a couple of time with my mentor Dick Brookfield. I surrounded myself with people who understood what I was going through and helped nurse me into the best version of myself. Life is so much better now than it was at anytime before my addiction. 

It's hard, looking back at the version of me that lived for my addiction when my biggest fear was not being able to find more Adderall. Who was that guy? That dude was broken...but not beyond repair. I have God to thank for that. My faith met me where I was and helped to remove the blanket of shame that had kept me broken. My church surrounded me with people that had been where I was and knew how to get me back on track. This has been by far the best decade of my life...and it's only getting better every day.

I have always been honest here on FB about my struggle. Believe me, it's not easy. But, I made a vow during recovery to use my experience to help others. If you are an addict, reach out to a friend, family member, Pastor, 12 step program, something. There is a better life out there...believe me...the road back is not easy...but it's worth every baby step after baby step. When all else is gone, God still loves you. That's a powerful thing when you fully comprehend it.",94,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44812882}"
2021-03-07 11:30:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lzu2rg/lessons_learned_from_my_current_relapse/,Lessons learned from my current relapse,"**TLDR** at the end, I'm a bit chatty today.

I had been clean for more or less one year.

I have now relapsed into my drug of choice (3-MMC).

I'm disappointed of myself but I'm not beating myself up. Nothing bad has happened yet, the damage is controlled, I'll get back up on my feet in no time.

I thought I'd share a few things I have discovered during this relapse.

First thing is that I was idealizing my drug of choice. Taking it again was very disappointing at first. I was expecting effects I didn't get. I even suspected I did not get the right product (but I did).

Second thing is that I'm now able to realize that I am not the best version of myself when I'm on drugs. Before, being high just felt absolutely right, as if I was reaching the real truth about myself and the world. Now, while I still enjoy the drugs very much, I have this feeling that there's something off, that the high is not the best thing that can be achieved in life, that it's a bit wrong.

Third thing, it took days of heavy use to start enjoying the drug like before again.

I did not believe drugs rewire the brain as much as they do.

I thought I just liked drugs. But it seems that liking drugs actually requires some level of effort / involvement. It's not innate. The way I see it now, drugs rewire the brain to make you enjoy them and this rewiring makes you enjoy the normal things less.

I've always known the theory but for the first time I'm seeing it happening to me. And it gives me hope. If my brain can be screwed this way it can also be unscrewed.

And the fact it took a few days for me to start feeling the effects of the drugs that I was remembering proved to me that abstinence had helped me reverse the damages of addiction quite a bit.

Lastly, of all the things I learned in various rehabs, the only one that is helping me right now is to reinvest in my relationships with my friends and family. Trying to be there for them keeps me alive. I make plans with friends and follow through, even when I think I'd have more fun just doing tons of lines alone in the dark. Keeps me from losing touch with the world, gives me the motivation to be a part of it.

Also, something that strangely nobody had ever suggested to me: I bought a time lock safe. I'm not ready to get rid of the stash right now, but with the safe I can commit to being sober for e.g. 24 hours which is already a win.

**TLDR**

- using again is not as fun as I was expecting it to be
- the way I feel and what I think when on drugs now in comparison to my previous period of use shows me I have made a lot of progress
- there's a huge physical component to addiction and time helps heal
- love is the answer

The classes can be monotonous, repetitive, have zero relevance to your life. You may dislike your assigned therapist. The 12 step program may be complete BS to you. However, your fellow “rehabees”, the variety of folks you meet in your 30, 90, however many days may just be your saving grace, or at least a source of friendship and shared experience during a rough period of your life. I’ve been to two rehabs (one for 30 one for 90), and while I did gain a lot of information from the daily routine, it was the people I learned it with that got me through and helped me stay clean afterwards. At a larger facility (about 50 clients), I was a 25 year old white kid from California, and my roommate was a 48 year old black cop from Tennessee. Our habits were different- I did heroin, he drank too much, but we became great friends. We’d stay up and talk about life, I’d tell him how I hid my drugs while using and he’d tell me that was all wrong and where the cops are trained to look etc, and I’d tell him about how intricate buying drugs from the dark web is and we’d laugh about it. We’ve stayed friends ever since, an unlikely duo. He’s the example I chose, but I also met plenty of other very sweet, good hearted men and women of all ages, backgrounds and persuasions who simply wanted to better themselves and be happy. My time spent talking to and seeing some of them after finishing the program kept me going. if somebody relapsed we supported them, but we all shared equal support and understanding. I’m going on two years clean. Some of my comrades have spiraled back down, others have a bunch of clean time. If you’re scared of rehab, just know that the folks running the place aren’t the only ones who can help you.

It has been a repetitive cycle for the last 6 years of my realizing/ discovering he is lying about it, me being mad and upset, him getting quick fix of help, then him doing well for a bit, life gets stressful and then back at it. 

Today, I (39f) watched him drink a beer on the porch, while on the phone. He thought I was still at work, wasn’t aware I had been home for 30 minutes in the house. He has supposedly been sober for 3 months. He realized I was watching and then hid it behind his back like a child. I walked out and dumped it over the railing, while i was fuming mad, i told him to leave. He laughed at me. All the while he is still on the phone. 
After a very heated argument, where he blamed it all on me and brought up a situation where I lied 12 years ago. I apologized profusely and took all the blame to end the argument . He sat in the car in the driveway for the next 4 hours and is now in the guest bed. Obviously, I could have handled it better, but sheer anger took hold of me. 

Iam not so mad at the alcohol, its the sneaking, hiding and lying that makes me furious. 

As a partner, how are these wounds healed, if ever?  

Clearly, I cant force him to get help, since no amount of conversation, crying, screaming or ultimatums have ever worked in a meaningful way. Maybe, its time I focus on helping myself through how to reconcile what Ive been through. I have struggled to pay for private therapy in the past to have it be consistent.

I started taking klonopin on and off about 2.5 months ago.  Not every day, would sometimes go days without them.  Dosing anywhere from 2-4 mg per day.  Well 3 weeks ago I decided to call a doctor and got an RX for xanex.  Started at .25 3x day.  I probably finished that bottle in 3 days.  She then upped it the next week to .5mg which again I took in 3-4 days.  I went 60 hours without last week and had some anxiety but could sleep and it wants unbearable.  I picked up my last script which was a 2 week supply and took 18mg in 5-6 days.  Knew I was abusing so said I’d had enough.  Gave the few remaining pills to my dad and tried to stop.  The next day I was miserable, depressed, low energy, and at about 36 hours i began feeling withdrawal.  Anxiety on the verge of panic, increased heart rate, and a feeling of dissociation(this was not severe but was very alarming to me) I then began to read all of the horror stories of benzo withdrawal and had no idea it could be so bad.  I’m hoping the fact that it has only been a few weeks on the stuff and sporadic use before will help.  Please no “your a junkie comments”.

First time posting here and really hope someone can help point me in the right direction. My brother is a heroin addict. He has been using on and off for a few years.

The most ideal situation (I think) would be to get him to a rehab center, but those are very expensive and we are not sure how we would cover the expenses. 

I have thought about inviting him to live with me, but last time that happened, he stole money from me and used my house for drug deals. It did not seem to help, but rather enable him to use in a situation that was more comfortable.

Around this time i lost my mother and over the course of 8 years i lost more than 9 loved ones who were close to me, wether it be through terminal illness, bad luck, and overdose. I lost most of my role models and people i would confide in when in need. Since the loss of my mother ages 10-13 i began drinking alcohol I’d steal from my friends alcoholic parents, smoking pot also given to us by parents, and taking oxy and hyrdros which we would get by frequently breaking into trailers of older people’s houses while they were away, also developed smoking cigarettes as well. When i was 13 i moved away from my home to another state. Without these things i felt empty and would often steal my dads cigarettes to slightly feel anything i used to. Fast forward to 16 i finally found friends, started drinking and smoking again. While i felt they did it for fun and i just wanted to fit in, i always knew i did for the purpose of pushing down my feelings. Around 17 i found pills again and over the course of a year i went overboard with them, but i never spoke to anyone about the addiction i had then or in the past, every time i did it i was hoping maybe it could all just end peacefully. I eventually was able to get myself off of them, this coming with the price of me completely becoming a extremely heavy pot smoker, the last 2 1/2 years i was so baked i wasn’t even myself anymore. Though I’ve always been confused on that my entire life. I’m 20 now and due to me getting a serious job I’ve done my best to give it all up. Often times now though i feel drawn back to the pills and alcohol even more being sober, pot kept those feelings away for so long. It’s like a craving, even though I’m much more happy now i just have days i feel like I’m in a cage i can’t get out of, that i might be a step closer to going back harder than ever, and i don’t want that. I don’t want to fuck up what i have now. I’ve been damaged for years now and addiction was in me from such a young age. I despise social media outlets, but I’m on here hoping to find answers and help. Maybe just one person to understand what’s going on with me, like i said I’ve always felt my friends have done it for fun, not because they have something to burn or hide what’s happened to them.

He moved away and went through all kinds of addiction treatment, got sober and seemed to be doing good for a few years. But eventually I started noticing behavior of him slipping a little. He got into gambling which seems to be somewhat common for people in recovery. I didn't really think much of it, especially because he was into poker and stuff before he was ever an addict. He also was doing testosterone but I didn't think much of that either. I did start to wonder if he was bending his view on sobriety a little. 

But then he started getting involved with drugs. Not using them to my knowledge, but seemingly wanting to be around them. He started to say his friend wanted weed etc, and asked me if I could get weed for his friend. I hung out with him another time and he brought Molly over that his neighbor had. He was basically pushing me to do the molly, but didn't do any with me. That same night I had weed and he said his friend wanted some and so I gave him some and he said he would pay me back. Keep in mind, although I do use drugs I never would ask him to do anything or even take anything out around him. I respected his sobriety and didn't want to see him relapse. After giving him the weed he ghosted me for several weeks. It kinda pissed me off because it was like $200 worth. I kept texting him but no answer. Eventually I asked him if he relapsed and that seemed to get a response. After that he answered me and said he was out of town or some bullshit but finally paid me the money. Since then though, he wants nothing to do with me. I used to hang out with him all the time. He even left this speaker at my house which is worth $100 and just never comes to get it. 

What do you think is going on exactly? Did he relapse and is unwilling to accept reality? Or is he bending his own rules a little and doesn't like that I see his behavior as a cause for concern? What do you think?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5790667}"

I'm being vague because I want advice from anyone in recovery, not just people in my program.  The hardest thing that is coming up for me as I fully commit myself to recovery is just how much time I have lost. I have blown up my life and moved several times. I have failed to really stick with a career and I think I sort of used Covid as an excuse to just drop out of the workforce for a year. I have sold all my belongings and moved several times.

At the time, it felt like I was making logical decisions but I now understand that I am missing out on a lot of milestones that other people in their late 20s are hitting. I don't have a job and will basically have to start a career from scratch. I sort of gave up on the progress I made towards my dream career that is very location-specific (because I left that location during Covid). I have signed a lease elsewhere and I think that's okay, but I'm feeling extremely regretful today. I wanted to be financially stable and a little bit more established by now, surrounded by things that I have chosen, with the financial freedom to travel and make choices for myself. I truly feel like a teenager starting from scratch today. 

30 is growing closer every day. I know that the only way out is through and that if I start making an effort now, I will be better off in a few years. It could STILL all be okay. I could still get the things I want and need out of life. I just didn't expect that the hardest part of recovery is you have to confront all the things you avoid. Like, fuck. Where has my head been?

2021-03-03 13:47:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lx18bx/dad_has_been_addicted_to_amphetamines_for_20_years/,Dad has been addicted to amphetamines for 20+ years,"My \[33M\] Dad \[60M\] has been addicted to methamphetamines for more than the past 2 decades. His trouble started way back in 1997 when he was arrested for trafficking large quantities of methamphetamines. At this time, dealing drugs was his way of supplementing his habit. As a result of this, he lost his government job, his marriage, and caused a massive rift within the family. He was able to circumvent any prison time by withdrawing his government pension and hiring the best attorney he could find. While his affiliated associates received several years of time in prison, my Dad skated by with 2 years of house arrest and 7 years of probation. 

Over the years he has attended at least 5 rehabilitation programs (some inpatient, some outpatient), relapsed several times, and been arrested 4 more times for violating the terms of his probation. There have been periodic episodes where I have no doubt in my mind that he was clean. He adhered to a normal sleep schedule, he began a successful consulting business, the ~~loser junkie~~ addict friends stopped coming around, he adopted new hobbies and passions, he spent time with his children \[33M, 30M, 23F\], and remarried.

In 2005, during the time in which I was 100% convinced that he was clean, I caught him snorting something off of his briefcase while sitting in the cab of his truck. I was devastated. He had come so far and was happily living life as a business owner (with more money than he knew what to do with) and his new wife. I confronted him about this immediately and while he showed genuine remorse and guilt, I can't be certain that he has had any moments of sobriety since then. 

In the years that have passed, I have grown up, finished college, started my own family and gradually distanced myself from him and his destructive behavior. I forever consigned myself to the notion that my Dad would always be a drug addict; rather than confronting him about his abuse I just put up my walls and instead decided that I would control the capacity to which he was involved with my family (limited). This strategy worked well for several years. I insulated myself from having to deal with the heartache surrounding his drug abuse by ignoring it all together and instead focused on providing a life for my family. 

This plan backfired early in 2020 when my disabled younger brother \[30M\] was admitted to the hospital for a fluid-filled sac in his testicle that required surgery. My Dad took my brother to the hospital, but the attending physician noticed that something was awry with both my Dad and my brother; they were acting out of sorts. Based on this hunch, the doctor ordered a drug test which revealed that my disabled younger brother tested positive for methamphetamines. \[Note: my brother does not have access to his own income, nor does he have access to his own transportation, so the likelihood that he obtained the methamphetamines on his own is highly unlikely.\]

I confronted my Dad about this and like the coward he is, he ran away before I could punch him in the teeth like he deserved. This was the last straw for his second marriage. She kicked him out and filed for divorce. Homeless and unemployed, he took up residence in an abandoned travel trailer in the middle of the woods on the destitute property of what I can only assume is another ~~junkie~~ addict. A few months pass and Dad calls in the middle of the night, sounding barely alive and on the brink of death. He seemed to be completely unaware that there was a global pandemic occurring and there was a good chance that he contracted the coronavirus. I urged him to call an ambulance and go to the hospital.

He called me after being admitted to the hospital and gleefully informed me ""the Doctor says I have COVID, I'm just glad it's not the coronavirus!"" This perfectly exemplifies how delusional and disconnected he was from the world in which we all live; he didn't know that COVID = coronavirus. Over the next 5 days in the hospital, we can only presume that he went through all of the stages of drug withdrawal. He would call us in the middle of the night complaining about games of Scrabble that were stuck in his head, lamenting on time lost with his family, and crying about how he wanted to change his life. We were elated. Perhaps this was the ""rock bottom"" that so many speak of.

With a renewed sense of purpose and direction, the family began searching for rehab options for an unemployed 60 year old man with no health insurance, medicare, medicaid, etc. My sister navigated this process and found a rehab program that would accept him once he could demonstrate that he had a negative COVID test. Against the wishes of my wife and family, I drove to the hospital once he was discharged and drove him to a nearby motel where I checked him into a room to quarantine for the next week so he could get a clean COVID test. My sister bought him clothes. I stopped by every night and brought him food until one day, he was gone.

Irate, I called him only to discover that he had his friend ""Crystal"" come pick him up. He indicated that he had no recollection of the obvious plan in motion for him to enter a rehab program and chalked up all of the midnight phone calls sobbing in tears from the hospital to side effects from the laborious toll that COVID had taken on his body. He was clueless that we had been bending over backwards to help him and ditched the idea before he even gave it a chance. We cut him off completely.

Due to our relatively uncommon last name, his ~~junkie~~ addict friends took to Facebook and began reaching out to me to tell me of all of his exploits. Apparently he was selling drugs out of his trailer compound, shacked up with a thirty-something ~~pillhead~~ drug user. My Dad inadvertently sent a text message to my brother that was embedded with all kinds of ""code words"". He talked of ""being 30 minutes out with the coffee beans"" (pills) and that he didn't have any money but he could bring a ""winchester 20 gauge pump shotty"" or maybe a ""lady trade for gen"" (prostitution?).

Months pass and he calls like nothing has happened, asking about my daughter's upcoming 1 year old birthday party, to which he was neither invited nor welcomed.  We told him that we have an absolute zero tolerance policy when it comes to him, his drugs, and our family. 

To this day, he refuses to acknowledge that he is using drugs and instead points to all of the incredible things that he has done for other people. Did you know that this Christmas he bought a bicycle for a little black boy from the hood? Did you know that ""Crystal"", the very girl that picked him up from the hotel, was once a pill addicted ~~junkie~~ addict and he gradually weaned her off dilaudid and she now lives like the Brady Bunch with her family? Did you know that every person in his life judges him unfairly for using methamphetamines because we recreationally smoke marijuana?

We are all fed up with his delusional mindset. Rant over.

I saw him 2 days ago, looking like a ""hobo"", when he said he'd come to visit me for 2 hours or so.

He only talked in strange analogies and metaphors, constantly.  None of them made sense.  He then started smoking crack in my house and wouldnt stop even when I asked him many times to not do it.

He later wouldn't leave my place, I had to kick him out.  He managed to forced his way inside the first security door then tried lockpocking my front door.  I called the police and they took him away.

He constantly said things like ""we must find the reason of the comprehension and for that we must lay the foundations of our will.  Will that is like a ship starring the the water and following it's passion.  I am 37% sure that this is the real truth.  I am like a lion in a cage, ready to bounce at any moment"" etc etc

The doctor I had made it mandatory for me to go to intensive outpatient rehab but its been really difficult recently to keep my sobriety. 
Though Im not addicted to anything in particular, I still feel like if someone offered me anything I’d take it. A few people in my life disregard my drug use and still ask where to get things or invite me to do drugs with them which is really hard to say no to (Im proud I have been able to recently). I also went through a very traumatic event recently and I just want to block it out which means going back to old habits.
I do want to get better cause I’m so young and I want to get past this but its very difficult especially when those around me disregard my problems with drug use. I have been consistent with rehab but its hard to just stop when its all I’ve known for the past two years.

Maybe your mom, dad, siblings, cousins, partner, a friend, a child, someone.



I want you to know that even though you might have betrayed these people in awful ways, you are still loved by them.




You decided to get cleaned up. Maybe it was not the first time, maybe you thought you could control it, the reasons don't matter.


What matters right now, today, is that you are here ready to make some small change, baby steps toward a better life.. Don't slip, don't slide back, not even once.


Your life is literally the most precious thing you have. Even if you are in pain and think death would be better, let me tell you, selfishly it's not better.


It's not better for me. It's not better for our parents, it's not better for our siblings, it's not better for your kids, it's not better for your wife. It's not better for your friends. Even your in-laws, they're destroyed.


You were such a big, loving, goofy wild man who I watched grow up and never did you lose our childhood wildness. I lost mine and I needed yours injected into my life to remind me how free it can be.




I need you to be one of ""us"", when the families take sides in things, you always took our family side. We were solid against the others.. Now it's just me and the little one. We need our tallest ally for having our backs.
Her and I are tough, but our brother had more fearlessness and could say what needed to be said.




You got better, things were looking good. But a little fight sent you back to that demon and I didn't know. You could have called me that night. I would have understood why she was mad and I would have been sympathetic to your reasons and I would have told you how much of a battle you were fighting and I was proud of you. But you chose that tiny little piece of what looks like dirt, wrapped in foil and everything else you could have ever been or done went up in smoke with it.

I'm about to call in for another sick day at work. I've had 2 bottles of wine and a 6 pack and was wondering if anyone could hit me up. Shame is the worst feeling we've learned as humans, I believe it literally serves no purpose and that it's a dysfunctional evolution, but that doesn't make it unreal. I feel so ashamed. My liver hurts. I'm supposed to be a healthy 28 year old person, I'm an engineer + finance grad, volunteer in mental health, contemporary dancer, maths teacher (at the moment), and a bit more. But each single creeping day my alcohol addiction is eating away at everything I love, and forcing myself to take everything I care for away from me. 

Each day I feel more and more like Sisyphus, the person from Roman Mythology, who was punished by Zeus with the impossible task of carrying a heavy stone to the top of a mountain. Only to find himself almost reaching the top, realizing the stone was too heavy to carry and to see it fall down the slope on the other side of the mountain. He kept up his impossible task until he died. I feel like each day I have to start all over, and carry my burden of shame, resentment and fear over what's happening right now to my own tipping point. And the sad part is, I really feel like I'm going to make it that day. My stone tips over and slides back down when I have to go to sleep, and I don't want to try to carry the burden again tomorrow.

It felt really good to type this and say how I feel, thank you for reading this.
